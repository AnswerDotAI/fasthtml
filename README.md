# FastHTML


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

Welcome to the official FastHTML documentation.

FastHTML is a new next-generation web framework for fast, scalable web
applications with minimal, compact code. It’s designed to be:

- Powerful and expressive enough to build the most advanced, interactive
  web apps you can imagine.
- Fast and lightweight, so you can write less code and get more done.
- Easy to learn and use, with a simple, intuitive syntax that makes it
  easy to build complex apps quickly.

FastHTML apps are just Python code, so you can use FastHTML with the
full power of the Python language and ecosystem.

## Installation

Since `fasthtml` is a Python library, you can install it with:

``` sh
pip install python-fasthtml
```

In the near future, we hope to add component libraries that can likewise
be installed via `pip`.

## Usage

For a minimal app, create a file “main.py” as follows:

<div class="code-with-filename">

**main.py**

``` python
from fasthtml.common import *

app, rt = fast_app()

@rt('/')
def get():
    return Div(P('Hello World!'), hx_get="/change")

serve()
```

</div>

Running the app with `python main.py` prints out a link to your running
app: `http://localhost:5001/`. Visit that link in your browser and you
should see a page with the title “FastHTML page” and the text “Hello 
World!”. Congratulations - you’ve just created your first `fasthtml` 
app!

Adding interactivity is surprisingly easy, thanks to HTMX. If you modify
the file to add this function…:

<div class="code-with-filename">

**main.py**

``` python
@rt('/change')
def get():
    return P('Nice to be here!')
```

</div>

…you’ll now have a page with a clickable element that changes the text
when clicked. When clicking on this link, the server will respond with
an “HTML partial”—that is, just a snippet of HTML which will be inserted
into the existing page. In this case, the returned element will replace
the original P element (since that’s the default behavior of HTMX) with
the new version returned by the second route.

This “hypermedia-based” approach to web development is a powerful way to
build web applications.

The capabilities of FastHTML are vast and growing, and not all the
features and patterns have been documented yet. Be prepared to invest
time into studying and modifying source code, such as the main FastHTML
repo’s notebooks and the official FastHTML examples repo:
