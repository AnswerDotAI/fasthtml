When your app redirects to the Stripe checkout URL, Stripe displays this secure payment form where customers enter their card details. For testing purposes, you can use Stripe's test card number (4242 4242 4242 4242) with any future expiration date and any 3-digit CVC code. This test card will successfully process payments in test mode without charging real money. The form shows the product name and price that were configured in your Stripe session, providing a seamless transition from your app to the payment processor and back again after completion."
