    "There's a fair bit going on here, so let's unpack what's happening in that code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- OAuth (and by extension our custom Auth class) has a number of default arguments, including some key URLs: `redir_path='/redirect', error_path='/error', logout_path='/logout', login_path='/login'`. It will create and handle the redirect and logout paths, and it's up to you to handle `/login` (where unsuccessful login attempts will be redirected) and `/error` (for oauth errors).\n",
    "- When we run `oauth = Auth(app, client)` it adds the redirect and logout paths to the app and also adds some beforeware. This beforeware runs on any requests (apart from any specified with the `skip` parameter). \n",
    "\n",
    "The added beforeware specifies some app behaviour:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If someone who isn't logged in attempts to visit our homepage (`/`) here, they will be redirected to `/login`.\n",
    "- If they are logged in, it calls a `check_invalid` method. This defaults to False, which let's the user continue to the page they requested. The behaviour can be modified by defining your own `check_invalid` method in the Auth class - for example, you could have this forcibly log out users who have recently been banned.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does someone log in? If they visit (or are redirected to) the login page at `/login`, we show them a login link. This sends them to the OAuth provider, where they'll go through the steps of selecting their account, giving permissions etc. Once done they will be redirected back to `/redirect`. Behind the scenes a code that comes as part of their request gets turned into user info, which is then passed to the key function `get_auth(self, info, ident, session, state)`. Here is where you'd handle looking up or adding a user in a database, checking for some condition (for example, this code checks if the email is an answer.ai email address) or choosing the destination based on state. The arguments are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `self`: the Auth object, which you can use to access the client (`self.cli`)\n",
    "- `info`: the information provided by the OAuth provider, typically including a unique user id, email address, username and other metadata.\n",
    "- `ident`: a unique identifier for this user. What this looks like varies between providers. This is useful for managing a database of users, for example.\n",
    "- `session`: the current session, that you can store information in securely\n",
    "- `state`: you can optionally pass in some state when creating the login link. This persists and is returned after the user goes through the Oath steps, which is useful for returning them to the same page they left. It can also be used as added security against CSRF attacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we check the email in `info` (we use a GoogleAppClient, not all providers will include an email). If we aren't happy, and get_auth returns False or nothing (as in the case here for non-answerai people) then the user is redirected back to the login page. But if everything looks good we return a redirect to the homepage, and an `auth` key is added to the session and the scope containing the users identity `ident`. So, for example, in the homepage route we could use `auth` to look up this particular user's profile info and customize the page accordingly. This auth will persist in their session until they clear the browser cache, so by default they'll stay logged in. To log them out, remove it ( `session.pop('auth', None)`) or send them to `/logout` which will do that for you. "
