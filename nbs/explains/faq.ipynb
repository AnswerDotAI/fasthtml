    "## Why is FastHTML developed using notebooks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people are under the impression that writing software in notebooks is bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&ab_channel=JeremyHoward). We've used Jupyter notebooks exported via `nbdev` to write a wide range of “very serious” software projects over the last three years. This includes deep learning libraries, API clients, Python language extensions, terminal user interfaces, web frameworks, and more!\n",
    "\n",
    "[nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) is a Jupyter-powered tool for writing software. Traditional programming environments throw away the result of your exploration in REPLs or notebooks. `nbdev` makes exploration an integral part of your workflow, all while promoting software engineering best practices.\n"

    "## Why not pyproject.toml for packaging?\n",
    "\n",
    "FastHTML uses a `setup.py` module instead of a `pyproject.toml` file to configure itself for installation. The reason for this is `pyproject.toml` is not compatible with [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/), which is what is used to write and build FastHTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nbdev project spent around a year trying to move to pyproject.toml but there was insufficient functionality in the toml-based approach to complete the transition. We invite those interested in moving this project `pyproject.toml` to contribute their efforts to making [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) work with that format."

    "\n",
    "Many have asked! We think there's no benefit... Python's positional and kw args precisely 1:1 map already to html/xml children and attrs, so there's no need for a new syntax.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Why use `import *`\n",
    "\n",
    "First, through the use of the [`__all__`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#importing-from-a-package) attribute in our Python modules we control what actually gets imported. So there's no risk of namespace pollution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, our style lends itself to working in rather compact Jupyter notebooks and small Python modules. Hence we know about the source code whose libraries we `import *` from. This terseness means we can develop faster. We're a small team, and any edge we can gain is important to us. \n",
    "\n",
    "Third, for external libraries, be it core Python, SQLAlchemy, or other things we do tend to use explicit imports. In part to avoid namespace collisions, and also as reference to know where things are coming from.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll finish by saying a lot of our users employ explicit imports. If that's the path you want to take, we encourage the use of `from fasthtml import common as fh`. The acronym of `fh` makes it easy to recognize that a symbol is from the FastHTML library."

    "## Can FastHTML be used for dashboards?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes it can. In fact, it excels at building dashboards. In addition to being great for building static dashboards, because of its [foundation](https://about.fastht.ml/foundation) in ASGI and [tech stack](https://about.fastht.ml/tech), FastHTML natively supports Websockets. That means using FastHTML we can create dashboards that autoupdate. "

    "If you are coming from a PEP-8 background where the use of ruff is encouraged, we won't deny there is a learning curve. However, once you get used to the **fastai coding style** you may discover yourself appreciating the concise nature of this style. It also encourages using more functional programming tooling, which is both productive and fun. "
