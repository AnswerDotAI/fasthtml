    "Many editors, including Visual Studio Code, use PyLance to provide error checking for Python. However, PyLance's error checking is just a guess -- it can't actually know whether your code is correct or not. PyLance particularly struggles with FastHTML's syntax, which leads to it often reporting false error messages in FastHTML projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid these misleading error messages, it's best to disable some PyLance error checking in your FastHTML projects. Here's how to do it in Visual Studio Code (the same approach should also work in other editors based on vscode, such as Cursor and GitHub Codespaces):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open your FastHTML project\n",
    "2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) to open the Command Palette\n",
    "3. Type \"Preferences: Open Workspace Settings (JSON)\" and select it\n",
    "4. In the JSON file that opens, add the following lines:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    " \"python.analysis.diagnosticSeverityOverrides\": {\n",
    "      \"reportGeneralTypeIssues\": \"none\",\n",

    "      \"reportAssignmentType\": \"none\",\n",

    "5. Save the file\n",

However, once you get used to the **fastai coding style** you may discover yourself appreciating the concise nature of this style. It also encourages using more functional programming tooling, which is both productive and fun. Having said that, it's entirely optional!"

    "First, through the use of the [`__all__`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#importing-from-a-package) attribute in our Python modules we control what actually gets imported. So there's no risk of namespace pollution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, our style lends itself to working in rather compact Jupyter notebooks and small Python modules. Hence we know about the source code whose libraries we `import *` from. This terseness means we can develop faster. We're a small team, and any edge we can gain is important to us. \n",
    "\n",
    "Third, for external libraries, be it core Python, SQLAlchemy, or other things we do tend to use explicit imports. In part to avoid namespace collisions, and also as reference to know where things are coming from.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll finish by saying a lot of our users employ explicit imports. If that's the path you want to take, we encourage the use of `from fasthtml import common as fh`. The acronym of `fh` makes it easy to recognize that a symbol is from the FastHTML library."

    "\n",
    "Yes it can. In fact, it excels at building dashboards. In addition to being great for building static dashboards, because of its [foundation](https://fastht.ml/about/foundation) in ASGI and [tech stack](https://fastht.ml/about/tech), FastHTML natively supports Websockets. That means using FastHTML we can create dashboards that autoupdate. "
