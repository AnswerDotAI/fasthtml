<project title="FastHTML" summary='FastHTML is a python library which brings together Starlette, Uvicorn, HTMX, and fastcore&#39;s `FT` "FastTags" into a library for creating server-rendered hypermedia applications. The `FastHTML` class itself inherits from `Starlette`, and adds decorator-based routing with many additions, Beforeware, automatic `FT` to HTML rendering, and much more.'>Things to remember when writing FastHTML apps:

- Although parts of its API are inspired by FastAPI, it is *not* compatible with FastAPI syntax and is not targeted at creating API services
- FastHTML includes support for Pico CSS and the fastlite sqlite library, although using both are optional; sqlalchemy can be used directly or via the fastsql library, and any CSS framework can be used. Support for the Surreal and css-scope-inline libraries are also included, but both are optional
- FastHTML is compatible with JS-native web components and any vanilla JS library, but not with React, Vue, or Svelte
- Use `serve()` for running uvicorn (`if __name__ == "__main__"` is not needed since it's automatic)
- When a title is needed with a response, use `Titled`; note that that already wraps children in `Container`, and already includes both the meta title as well as the H1 element.<docs><doc title="FastHTML quick start" desc="A brief overview of many FastHTML features"># Web Devs Quickstart



## Installation

``` bash
pip install python-fasthtml
```

## A Minimal Application

A minimal FastHTML application looks something like this:

<div class="code-with-filename">

**main.py**

``` python
from fasthtml.common import *

app, rt = fast_app()

@rt("/")
def get():
    return Titled("FastHTML", P("Let's do this!"))

serve()
```

</div>

Line 1  
We import what we need for rapid development! A carefully-curated set of
FastHTML functions and other Python objects is brought into our global
namespace for convenience.

Line 3  
We instantiate a FastHTML app with the `fast_app()` utility function.
This provides a number of really useful defaults that we’ll take
advantage of later in the tutorial.

Line 5  
We use the `rt()` decorator to tell FastHTML what to return when a user
visits `/` in their browser.

Line 6  
We connect this route to HTTP GET requests by defining a view function
called `get()`.

Line 7  
A tree of Python function calls that return all the HTML required to
write a properly formed web page. You’ll soon see the power of this
approach.

Line 9  
The
[`serve()`](https://AnswerDotAI.github.io/fasthtml/api/core.html#serve)
utility configures and runs FastHTML using a library called `uvicorn`.

Run the code:

``` bash
python main.py
```

The terminal will look like this:

``` bash
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:5001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [58058] using WatchFiles
INFO:     Started server process [58060]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

Confirm FastHTML is running by opening your web browser to
[127.0.0.1:5001](http://127.0.0.1:5001). You should see something like
the image below:

![](quickstart-web-dev/quickstart-fasthtml.png)

<div>

> **Note**

> While some linters and developers will complain about the wildcard

</div>

## A Minimal Charting Application

The
[`Script`](https://AnswerDotAI.github.io/fasthtml/api/xtend.html#script)
function allows you to include JavaScript. You can use Python to
generate parts of your JS or JSON like this:

``` python
import json
from fasthtml.common import * 

app, rt = fast_app(hdrs=(Script(src="https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-2.32.0.min.js"),))

data = json.dumps({
    "data": [{"x": [1, 2, 3, 4],"type": "scatter"},
            {"x": [1, 2, 3, 4],"y": [16, 5, 11, 9],"type": "scatter"}],
    "title": "Plotly chart in FastHTML ",
    "description": "This is a demo dashboard",
    "type": "scatter"
})


@rt("/")
def get():
  return Titled("Chart Demo", Div(id="myDiv"),
    Script(f"var data = {data}; Plotly.newPlot('myDiv', data);"))

serve()
```

## Debug Mode

When we can’t figure out a bug in FastHTML, we can run it in `DEBUG`
mode. When an error is thrown, the error screen is displayed in the
browser. This error setting should never be used in a deployed app.

``` python
from fasthtml.common import *

app, rt = fast_app(debug=True)

@rt("/")
def get():
    1/0
    return Titled("FastHTML Error!", P("Let's error!"))

serve()
```

Line 3  
`debug=True` sets debug mode on.

Line 7  
Python throws an error when it tries to divide an integer by zero.

## Routing

FastHTML builds upon FastAPI’s friendly decorator pattern for specifying
URLs, with extra features:

<div class="code-with-filename">

**main.py**

``` python
from fasthtml.common import * 

app, rt = fast_app()

@rt("/")
def get():
  return Titled("FastHTML", P("Let's do this!"))

@rt("/hello")
def get():
  return Titled("Hello, world!")

serve()
```

</div>

Line 5  
The “/” URL on line 5 is the home of a project. This would be accessed
at [127.0.0.1:5001](http://127.0.0.1:5001).

Line 9  
“/hello” URL on line 9 will be found by the project if the user visits
[127.0.0.1:5001/hello](http://127.0.0.1:5001/hello).

<div>

> **Tip**
>
> It looks like `get()` is being defined twice, but that’s not the case.
> Each function decorated with `rt` is totally separate, and is injected
> into the router. We’re not calling them in the module’s namespace
> (`locals()`). Rather, we’re loading them into the routing mechanism
> using the `rt` decorator.

</div>

You can do more! Read on to learn what we can do to make parts of the
URL dynamic.

## Variables in URLs

You can add variable sections to a URL by marking them with
`{variable_name}`. Your function then receives the `{variable_name}` as
a keyword argument, but only if it is the correct type. Here’s an
example:

<div class="code-with-filename">

**main.py**

``` python
from fasthtml.common import * 

app, rt = fast_app()

@rt("/{name}/{age}")
def get(name: str, age: int):
  return Titled(f"Hello {name.title()}, age {age}")

serve()
```

</div>

Line 5  
We specify two variable names, `name` and `age`.

Line 6  
We define two function arguments named identically to the variables. You
will note that we specify the Python types to be passed.

Line 7  
We use these functions in our project.

Try it out by going to this address:
[127.0.0.1:5001/uma/5](http://127.0.0.1:5001/uma/5). You should get a
page that says,

> “Hello Uma, age 5”.

### What happens if we enter incorrect data?

The [127.0.0.1:5001/uma/5](http://127.0.0.1:5001/uma/5) URL works
because `5` is an integer. If we enter something that is not, such as
[127.0.0.1:5001/uma/five](http://127.0.0.1:5001/uma/five), then FastHTML
will return an error instead of a web page.

<div>

> **FastHTML URL routing supports more complex types**
>
> The two examples we provide here use Python’s built-in `str` and `int`
> types, but you can use your own types, including more complex ones
> such as those defined by libraries like
> [attrs](https://pypi.org/project/attrs/),
> [pydantic](https://pypi.org/project/pydantic/), and even
> [sqlmodel](https://pypi.org/project/sqlmodel/).

</div>

## HTTP Methods

FastHTML matches function names to HTTP methods. So far the URL routes
we’ve defined have been for HTTP GET methods, the most common method for
web pages.

Form submissions often are sent as HTTP POST. When dealing with more
dynamic web page designs, also known as Single Page Apps (SPA for
short), the need can arise for other methods such as HTTP PUT and HTTP
DELETE. The way FastHTML handles this is by changing the function name.

<div class="code-with-filename">

**main.py**

``` python
from fasthtml.common import * 

app, rt = fast_app()

@rt("/")  
def get():
  return Titled("HTTP GET", P("Handle GET"))

@rt("/")  
def post():
  return Titled("HTTP POST", P("Handle POST"))

serve()
```

</div>

Line 6  
On line 6 because the `get()` function name is used, this will handle
HTTP GETs going to the `/` URI.

Line 10  
On line 10 because the `post()` function name is used, this will handle
HTTP POSTs going to the `/` URI.

## CSS Files and Inline Styles

Here we modify default headers to demonstrate how to use the [Sakura CSS
microframework](https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura) instead of FastHTML’s
default of Pico CSS.

<div class="code-with-filename">

**main.py**

``` python
from fasthtml.common import * 

app, rt = fast_app(
    pico=False,
    hdrs=(
        Link(rel='stylesheet', href='assets/normalize.min.css', type='text/css'),
        Link(rel='stylesheet', href='assets/sakura.css', type='text/css'),
        Style("p {color: red;}")
))

@app.get("/")
def home():
    return Titled("FastHTML",
        P("Let's do this!"),
    )

serve()
```

</div>

Line 4  
By setting `pico` to `False`, FastHTML will not include `pico.min.css`.

Line 7  
This will generate an HTML `<link>` tag for sourcing the css for Sakura.

Line 8  
If you want an inline styles, the
[`Style()`](https://AnswerDotAI.github.io/fasthtml/api/xtend.html#style)
function will put the result into the HTML.

## Other Static Media File Locations

As you saw,
[`Script`](https://AnswerDotAI.github.io/fasthtml/api/xtend.html#script)
and `Link` are specific to the most common static media use cases in web
apps: including JavaScript, CSS, and images. But it also works with
videos and other static media files. The default behavior is to look for
these files in the root directory - typically we don’t do anything
special to include them. We can change the default directory that is
looked in for files by adding the `static_path` parameter to the
`fast_app` function.

``` python
app, rt = fast_app(static_path='public')
```

FastHTML also allows us to define a route that uses `FileResponse` to
serve the file at a specified path. This is useful for serving images,
videos, and other media files from a different directory without having
to change the paths of many files. So if we move the directory
containing the media files, we only need to change the path in one
place. In the example below, we call images from a directory called
`public`.

``` python
@rt("/{fname:path}.{ext:static}")
async def get(fname:str, ext:str): 
    return FileResponse(f'public/{fname}.{ext}')
```

## Rendering Markdown

``` python
from fasthtml.common import *

hdrs = (MarkdownJS(), HighlightJS(langs=['python', 'javascript', 'html', 'css']), )

app, rt = fast_app(hdrs=hdrs)

content = """
Here are some _markdown_ elements.

- This is a list item
- This is another list item
- And this is a third list item

**Fenced code blocks work here.**
"""

@rt('/')
def get(req):
    return Titled("Markdown rendering example", Div(content,cls="marked"))

serve()
```

## Code highlighting

Here’s how to highlight code without any markdown configuration.

``` python
from fasthtml.common import *

# Add the HighlightJS built-in header
hdrs = (HighlightJS(langs=['python', 'javascript', 'html', 'css']),)

app, rt = fast_app(hdrs=hdrs)

code_example = """
import datetime
import time

for i in range(10):
    print(f"{datetime.datetime.now()}")
    time.sleep(1)
"""

@rt('/')
def get(req):
    return Titled("Markdown rendering example",
        Div(
            # The code example needs to be surrounded by
            # Pre & Code elements
            Pre(Code(code_example))
    ))

serve()
```

## Defining new `ft` components

We can build our own `ft` components and combine them with other
components. The simplest method is defining them as a function.

``` python
from fasthtml.common import *
```

``` python
def hero(title, statement):
    return Div(H1(title),P(statement), cls="hero")

# usage example
Main(
    hero("Hello World", "This is a hero statement")
)
```

``` html
<main>  <div class="hero">
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This is a hero statement</p>
  </div>
</main>
```

### Pass through components

For when we need to define a new component that allows zero-to-many
components to be nested within them, we lean on Python’s `*args` and
`**kwargs` mechanism. Useful for creating page layout controls.

``` python
def layout(*args, **kwargs):
    """Dashboard layout for all our dashboard views"""
    return Main(
        H1("Dashboard"),
        Div(*args, **kwargs),
        cls="dashboard",
    )

# usage example
layout(
    Ul(*[Li(o) for o in range(3)]),
    P("Some content", cls="description"),
)
```

``` html
<main class="dashboard">  <h1>Dashboard</h1>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>0</li>
      <li>1</li>
      <li>2</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="description">Some content</p>
  </div>
</main>
```

### Dataclasses as ft components

While functions are easy to read, for more complex components some might
find it easier to use a dataclass.

``` python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Hero:
    title: str
    statement: str
    
    def __ft__(self):
        """ The __ft__ method renders the dataclass at runtime."""
        return Div(H1(self.title),P(self.statement), cls="hero")
    
# usage example
Main(
    Hero("Hello World", "This is a hero statement")
)
```

``` html
<main>  <div class="hero">
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This is a hero statement</p>
  </div>
</main>
```

## Testing views in notebooks

Because of the ASGI event loop it is currently impossible to run
FastHTML inside a notebook. However, we can still test the output of our
views. To do this, we leverage Starlette, an ASGI toolkit that FastHTML
uses.

``` python
# First we instantiate our app, in this case we remove the
# default headers to reduce the size of the output.
app, rt = fast_app(default_hdrs=False)

# Setting up the Starlette test client
from starlette.testclient import TestClient
client = TestClient(app)

# Usage example
@rt("/")
def get():
    return Titled("FastHTML is awesome", 
        P("The fastest way to create web apps in Python"))

print(client.get("/").text)
```

     <!doctype html>
     <html>
       <head>
    <title>FastHTML is awesome</title>   </head>
       <body>
    <main class="container">       <h1>FastHTML is awesome</h1>
           <p>The fastest way to create web apps in Python</p>
    </main>   </body>
     </html>

## Forms

To validate data coming from users, first define a dataclass
representing the data you want to check. Here’s an example representing
a signup form.

``` python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Profile: email:str; phone:str; age:int
```

Create an FT component representing an empty version of that form. Don’t
pass in any value to fill the form, that gets handled later.

``` python
profile_form = Form(method="post", action="/profile")(
        Fieldset(
            Label('Email', Input(name="email")),
            Label("Phone", Input(name="phone")),
            Label("Age", Input(name="age")),
        ),
        Button("Save", type="submit"),
    )
profile_form
```

``` html
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post" action="/profile"><fieldset><label>Email      <input name="email">
</label><label>Phone      <input name="phone">
</label><label>Age      <input name="age">
</label></fieldset><button type="submit">Save</button></form>
```

Once the dataclass and form function are completed, we can add data to
the form. To do that, instantiate the profile dataclass:

``` python
profile = Profile(email='john@example.com', phone='123456789', age=5)
profile
```

    Profile(email='john@example.com', phone='123456789', age=5)

Then add that data to the `profile_form` using FastHTML’s
[`fill_form`](https://AnswerDotAI.github.io/fasthtml/api/components.html#fill_form)
class:

``` python
fill_form(profile_form, profile)
```

``` html
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post" action="/profile"><fieldset><label>Email      <input name="email" value="john@example.com">
</label><label>Phone      <input name="phone" value="123456789">
</label><label>Age      <input name="age" value="5">
</label></fieldset><button type="submit">Save</button></form>
```

### Forms with views

The usefulness of FastHTML forms becomes more apparent when they are
combined with FastHTML views. We’ll show how this works by using the
test client from above. First, let’s create a SQlite database:

``` python
db = database("profiles.db")
profiles = db.create(Profile, pk="email")
```

Now we insert a record into the database:

``` python
profiles.insert(profile)
```

    Profile(email='john@example.com', phone='123456789', age=5)

And we can then demonstrate in the code that form is filled and
displayed to the user.

``` python
@rt("/profile/{email}")
def profile(email:str):
    profile = profiles[email]
    filled_profile_form = fill_form(profile_form, profile)
    return Titled(f'Profile for {profile.email}', filled_profile_form)

print(client.get(f"/profile/john@example.com").text)
```

Line 3  
Fetch the profile using the profile table’s `email` primary key

Line 4  
Fill the form for display.


     <!doctype html>
     <html>
       <head>
    <title>Profile for john@example.com</title>   </head>
       <body>
    <main class="container">       <h1>Profile for john@example.com</h1>
    <form enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post" action="/profile"><fieldset><label>Email             <input name="email" value="john@example.com">
    </label><label>Phone             <input name="phone" value="123456789">
    </label><label>Age             <input name="age" value="5">
    </label></fieldset><button type="submit">Save</button></form></main>   </body>
     </html>

And now let’s demonstrate making a change to the data.

``` python
@rt("/profile")
def post(profile: Profile):
    profiles.update(profile)
    return RedirectResponse(url=f"/profile/{profile.email}")

new_data = dict(email='john@example.com', phone='7654321', age=25)
print(client.post("/profile", data=new_data).text)
```

Line 2  
We use the `Profile` dataclass definition to set the type for the
incoming `profile` content. This validates the field types for the
incoming data

Line 3  
Taking our validated data, we updated the profiles table

Line 4  
We redirect the user back to their profile view

Line 7  
The display is of the profile form view showing the changes in data.


     <!doctype html>
     <html>
       <head>
    <title>Profile for john@example.com</title>   </head>
       <body>
    <main class="container">       <h1>Profile for john@example.com</h1>
    <form enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post" action="/profile"><fieldset><label>Email             <input name="email" value="john@example.com">
    </label><label>Phone             <input name="phone" value="7654321">
    </label><label>Age             <input name="age" value="25">
    </label></fieldset><button type="submit">Save</button></form></main>   </body>
     </html>

## Strings and conversion order

The general rules for rendering are: - `__ft__` method will be called
(for default components like `P`, `H2`, etc. or if you define your own
components) - If you pass a string, it will be escaped - On other python
objects, `str()` will be called

As a consequence, if you want to include plain HTML tags directly into
e.g. a `Div()` they will get escaped by default (as a security measure
to avoid code injections). This can be avoided by using `NotStr()`, a
convenient way to reuse python code that returns already HTML. If you
use pandas, you can use `pandas.DataFrame.to_html()` to get a nice
table. To include the output a FastHTML, wrap it in `NotStr()`, like
`Div(NotStr(df.to_html()))`.

Above we saw how a dataclass behaves with the `__ft__` method defined.
On a plain dataclass, `str()` will be called (but not escaped).

``` python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Hero:
    title: str
    statement: str
        
# rendering the dataclass with the default method
Main(
    Hero("<h1>Hello World</h1>", "This is a hero statement")
)
```

``` html
<main>Hero(title='<h1>Hello World</h1>', statement='This is a hero statement')</main>
```

``` python
# This will display the HTML as text on your page
Div("Let's include some HTML here: <div>Some HTML</div>")
```

``` html
<div>Let&#x27;s include some HTML here: &lt;div&gt;Some HTML&lt;/div&gt;</div>
```

``` python
# Keep the string untouched, will be rendered on the page
Div(NotStr("<div><h1>Some HTML</h1></div>"))
```

``` html
<div><div><h1>Some HTML</h1></div></div>
```

## Custom exception handlers

FastHTML allows customization of exception handlers, but does so
gracefully. What this means is by default it includes all the `<html>`
tags needed to display attractive content. Try it out!

``` python
from fasthtml.common import *

def not_found(req, exc): return Titled("404: I don't exist!")

exception_handlers = {404: not_found}

app, rt = fast_app(exception_handlers=exception_handlers)

@rt('/')
def get():
    return (Titled("Home page", P(A(href="/oops")("Click to generate 404 error"))))

serve()
```

We can also use lambda to make things more terse:

``` python
from fasthtml.common import *

exception_handlers={
    404: lambda req, exc: Titled("404: I don't exist!"),
    418: lambda req, exc: Titled("418: I'm a teapot!")
}

app, rt = fast_app(exception_handlers=exception_handlers)

@rt('/')
def get():
    return (Titled("Home page", P(A(href="/oops")("Click to generate 404 error"))))

serve()
```

## Cookies

We can set cookies using the
[`cookie()`](https://AnswerDotAI.github.io/fasthtml/api/core.html#cookie)
function. In our example, we’ll create a `timestamp` cookie.

``` python
from datetime import datetime
from IPython.display import HTML
```

``` python
@rt("/settimestamp")
def get(req):
    now = datetime.now()
    return P(f'Set to {now}'), cookie('now', datetime.now())

HTML(client.get('/settimestamp').text)
```

 <!doctype html>
 <html>
   <head>
<title>FastHTML page</title>   </head>
   <body>
     <p>Set to 2024-09-26 15:33:48.141869</p>
   </body>
 </html>

Now let’s get it back using the same name for our parameter as the
cookie name.

``` python
@rt('/gettimestamp')
def get(now:parsed_date): return f'Cookie was set at time {now.time()}'

client.get('/gettimestamp').text
```

    'Cookie was set at time 15:33:48.141903'

## Sessions

For convenience and security, FastHTML has a mechanism for storing small
amounts of data in the user’s browser. We can do this by adding a
`session` argument to routes. FastHTML sessions are Python dictionaries,
and we can leverage to our benefit. The example below shows how to
concisely set and get sessions.

``` python
@rt('/adder/{num}')
def get(session, num: int):
    session.setdefault('sum', 0)
    session['sum'] = session.get('sum') + num
    return Response(f'The sum is {session["sum"]}.')
```

## Toasts (also known as Messages)

Toasts, sometimes called “Messages” are small notifications usually in
colored boxes used to notify users that something has happened. Toasts
can be of four types:

- info
- success
- warning
- error

Examples toasts might include:

- “Payment accepted”
- “Data submitted”
- “Request approved”

Toasts require the use of the `setup_toasts()` function plus every view
needs these two features:

- The session argument
- Must return FT components

``` python
setup_toasts(app)

@rt('/toasting')
def get(session):
    # Normally one toast is enough, this allows us to see
    # different toast types in action.
    add_toast(session, f"Toast is being cooked", "info")
    add_toast(session, f"Toast is ready", "success")
    add_toast(session, f"Toast is getting a bit crispy", "warning")
    add_toast(session, f"Toast is burning!", "error")
    return Titled("I like toast")
```

Line 1  
`setup_toasts` is a helper function that adds toast dependencies.
Usually this would be declared right after `fast_app()`

Line 4  
Toasts require sessions

Line 11  
Views with Toasts must return FT or FtResponse components.

💡 `setup_toasts` takes a `duration` input that allows you to specify
how long a toast will be visible before disappearing. For example
`setup_toasts(duration=5)` sets the toasts duration to 5 seconds. By
default toasts disappear after 10 seconds.

## Authentication and authorization

In FastHTML the tasks of authentication and authorization are handled
with Beforeware. Beforeware are functions that run before the route
handler is called. They are useful for global tasks like ensuring users
are authenticated or have permissions to access a view.

First, we write a function that accepts a request and session arguments:

``` python
# Status code 303 is a redirect that can change POST to GET,
# so it's appropriate for a login page.
login_redir = RedirectResponse('/login', status_code=303)

def user_auth_before(req, sess):
    # The `auth` key in the request scope is automatically provided
    # to any handler which requests it, and can not be injected
    # by the user using query params, cookies, etc, so it should
    # be secure to use.    
    auth = req.scope['auth'] = sess.get('auth', None)
    # If the session key is not there, it redirects to the login page.
    if not auth: return login_redir
```

Now we pass our `user_auth_before` function as the first argument into a
[`Beforeware`](https://AnswerDotAI.github.io/fasthtml/api/core.html#beforeware)
class. We also pass a list of regular expressions to the `skip`
argument, designed to allow users to still get to the home and login
pages.

``` python
beforeware = Beforeware(
    user_auth_before,
    skip=[r'/favicon\.ico', r'/static/.*', r'.*\.css', r'.*\.js', '/login', '/']
)

app, rt = fast_app(before=beforeware)
```

## Server-sent events (SSE)

With [server-sent
events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events),
it’s possible for a server to send new data to a web page at any time,
by pushing messages to the web page. Unlike WebSockets, SSE can only go
in one direction: server to client. SSE is also part of the HTTP
specification unlike WebSockets which uses its own specification.

FastHTML introduces several tools for working with SSE which are covered
in the example below. While concise, there’s a lot going on in this
function so we’ve annotated it quite a bit.

``` python
import random
from asyncio import sleep
from fasthtml.common import *

hdrs=(Script(src="https://unpkg.com/htmx-ext-sse@2.2.1/sse.js"),)
app,rt = fast_app(hdrs=hdrs)

@rt
def index():
    return Titled("SSE Random Number Generator",
        P("Generate pairs of random numbers, as the list grows scroll downwards."),
        Div(hx_ext="sse",
            sse_connect="/number-stream",
            hx_swap="beforeend show:bottom",
            sse_swap="message"))

shutdown_event = signal_shutdown()

async def number_generator():
    while not shutdown_event.is_set():
        data = Article(random.randint(1, 100))
        yield sse_message(data)
        await sleep(1)

@rt("/number-stream")
async def get(): return EventStream(number_generator())
```

Line 5  
Import the HTMX SSE extension

Line 12  
Tell HTMX to load the SSE extension

Line 13  
Look at the `/number-stream` endpoint for SSE content

Line 14  
When new items come in from the SSE endpoint, add them at the end of the
current content within the div. If they go beyond the screen, scroll
downwards

Line 15  
Specify the name of the event. FastHTML’s default event name is
“message”. Only change if you have more than one call to SSE endpoints
within a view

Line 17  
Set up the asyncio event loop

Line 19  
Don’t forget to make this an `async` function!

Line 20  
Iterate through the asyncio event loop

Line 22  
We yield the data. Data ideally should be comprised of FT components as
that plugs nicely into HTMX in the browser

Line 26  
The endpoint view needs to be an async function that returns a
[`EventStream`](https://AnswerDotAI.github.io/fasthtml/api/core.html#eventstream)

## Websockets

With websockets we can have bi-directional communications between a
browser and client. Websockets are useful for things like chat and
certain types of games. While websockets can be used for single
direction messages from the server (i.e. telling users that a process is
finished), that task is arguably better suited for SSE.

FastHTML provides useful tools for adding websockets to your pages.

``` python
from fasthtml.common import *
from asyncio import sleep

app, rt = fast_app(exts='ws')

def mk_inp(): return Input(id='msg', autofocus=True)

@rt('/')
async def get(request):
    cts = Div(
        Div(id='notifications'),
        Form(mk_inp(), id='form', ws_send=True),
        hx_ext='ws', ws_connect='/ws')
    return Titled('Websocket Test', cts)

async def on_connect(send):
    print('Connected!')
    await send(Div('Hello, you have connected', id="notifications"))

async def on_disconnect(ws):
    print('Disconnected!')

@app.ws('/ws', conn=on_connect, disconn=on_disconnect)
async def ws(msg:str, send):
    await send(Div('Hello ' + msg, id="notifications"))
    await sleep(2)
    return Div('Goodbye ' + msg, id="notifications"), mk_inp()
```

Line 4  
To use websockets in FastHTML, you must instantiate the app with `exts`
set to ‘ws’

Line 6  
As we want to use websockets to reset the form, we define the `mk_input`
function that can be called from multiple locations

Line 12  
We create the form and mark it with the `ws_send` attribute, which is
documented here in the [HTMX websocket
specification](https://v1.htmx.org/extensions/web-sockets/). This tells
HTMX to send a message to the nearest websocket based on the trigger for
the form element, which for forms is pressing the `enter` key, an action
considered to be a form submission

Line 13  
This is where the HTMX extension is loaded (`hx_ext='ws'`) and the
nearest websocket is defined (`ws_connect='/ws'`)

Line 16  
When a websocket first connects we can optionally have it call a
function that accepts a `send` argument. The `send` argument will push a
message to the browser.

Line 18  
Here we use the `send` function that was passed into the `on_connect`
function to send a `Div` with an `id` of `notifications` that HTMX
assigns to the element in the page that already has an `id` of
`notifications`

Line 20  
When a websocket disconnects we can call a function which takes no
arguments. Typically the role of this function is to notify the server
to take an action. In this case, we print a simple message to the
console

Line 23  
We use the `app.ws` decorator to mark that `/ws` is the route for our
websocket. We also pass in the two optional `conn` and `disconn`
parameters to this decorator. As a fun experiment, remove the `conn` and
`disconn` arguments and see what happens

Line 24  
Define the `ws` function as async. This is necessary for ASGI to be able
to serve websockets. The function accepts two arguments, a `msg` that is
user input from the browser, and a `send` function for pushing data back
to the browser

Line 25  
The `send` function is used here to send HTML back to the page. As the
HTML has an `id` of `notifications`, HTMX will overwrite what is already
on the page with the same ID

Line 27  
The websocket function can also be used to return a value. In this case,
it is a tuple of two HTML elements. HTMX will take the elements and
replace them where appropriate. As both have `id` specified
(`notifications` and `msg` respectively), they will replace their
predecessor on the page.

## File Uploads

A common task in web development is uploading files. The examples below
are for uploading files to the hosting server, with information about
the uploaded file presented to the user.

<div>

> **File uploads in production can be dangerous**

</div>

### Single File Uploads

``` python
from fasthtml.common import *
from pathlib import Path

app, rt = fast_app()

upload_dir = Path("filez")
upload_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

@rt('/')
def get():
    return Titled("File Upload Demo",
        Article(
            Form(hx_post=upload, hx_target="#result-one")(
                Input(type="file", name="file"),
                Button("Upload", type="submit", cls='secondary'),
            ),
            Div(id="result-one")
        )
    )

def FileMetaDataCard(file):
    return Article(
        Header(H3(file.filename)),
        Ul(
            Li('Size: ', file.size),            
            Li('Content Type: ', file.content_type),
            Li('Headers: ', file.headers),
        )
    )    

@rt
async def upload(file: UploadFile):
    card = FileMetaDataCard(file)
    filebuffer = await file.read()
    (upload_dir / file.filename).write_bytes(filebuffer)
    return card

serve()
```

Line 13  
Every form rendered with the
[`Form`](https://AnswerDotAI.github.io/fasthtml/api/xtend.html#form) FT
component defaults to `enctype="multipart/form-data"`

Line 14  
Don’t forget to set the `Input` FT Component’s type to `file`

Line 32  
The upload view should receive a [Starlette
UploadFile](https://www.starlette.io/requests/#request-files) type. You
can add other form variables

Line 33  
We can access the metadata of the card (filename, size, content_type,
headers), a quick and safe process. We set that to the card variable

Line 34  
In order to access the contents contained within a file we use the
`await` method to read() it. As files may be quite large or contain bad
data, this is a seperate step from accessing metadata

Line 35  
This step shows how to use Python’s built-in `pathlib.Path` library to
write the file to disk.

### Multiple File Uploads

``` python
from fasthtml.common import *
from pathlib import Path

app, rt = fast_app()

upload_dir = Path("filez")
upload_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

@rt('/')
def get():

                Input(type="file", name="files", multiple=True),
                Button("Upload", type="submit", cls='secondary'),
            ),
            Div(id="result-many")
        )

            Li('Content Type: ', file.content_type),
            Li('Headers: ', file.headers),
        )
    )    

@rt
async def upload_many(files: list[UploadFile]):
    cards = []
    for file in files:
        cards.append(FileMetaDataCard(file))
        filebuffer = await file.read()
        (upload_dir / file.filename).write_bytes(filebuffer)
    return cards

| `htmx.config.methodsThatUseUrlParams` | defaults to `["get", "delete"]`, htmx will format requests with these methods by encoding their parameters in the URL, not the request body                                |
| `htmx.config.selfRequestsOnly`        | defaults to `true`, whether to only allow AJAX requests to the same domain as the current document                                                             |
| `htmx.config.ignoreTitle`             | defaults to `false`, if set to `true` htmx will not update the title of the document when a `title` tag is found in new content                                            |
| `htmx.config.scrollIntoViewOnBoost`   | defaults to `true`, whether or not the target of a boosted element is scrolled into the viewport. If `hx-target` is omitted on a boosted element, the target defaults to `body`, causing the page to scroll to the top. |
| `htmx.config.triggerSpecsCache`       | defaults to `null`, the cache to store evaluated trigger specifications into, improving parsing performance at the cost of more memory usage. You may define a simple object to use a never-clearing cache, or implement your own system using a [proxy object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) |
| `htmx.config.responseHandling`        | the default [Response Handling](@/docs.md#response-handling) behavior for response status codes can be configured here to either swap or error                             |
| `htmx.config.allowNestedOobSwaps`     | defaults to `true`, whether to process OOB swaps on elements that are nested within the main response element. See [Nested OOB Swaps](@/attributes/hx-swap-oob.md#nested-oob-swaps). |

## Why does this exist?

For devs who love ergonomics! You may appreciate Surreal if:

* You want to stay as close as possible to Vanilla JS.
* Hate typing `document.querySelector` over.. and over..
* Hate typing `addEventListener` over.. and over..
* Really wish `document.querySelectorAll` had Array functions..
* Really wish `this` would work in any inline `<script>` tag
* Enjoyed using jQuery selector syntax.
* [Animations, timelines, tweens](#-quick-start) with no extra libraries.
* Only 320 lines. No build step. No dependencies.
* Pairs well with [htmx](https://htmx.org)
* Want fewer layers, less complexity. Are aware of the cargo cult. ✈️

## ✨ What does it add to Javascript?

* ⚡️ [Locality of Behavior (LoB)](https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/) Use `me()` inside `<script>`
  * No **.class** or **#id** needed! Get an element without creating a unique name.
  * `this` but much more flexible!
  * Want `me` in your CSS `<style>` tags, too? See our [companion script](https://github.com/gnat/css-scope-inline)
* 🔗 Call chaining, jQuery style.
* ♻️ Functions work seamlessly on 1 element or arrays of elements!
  * All functions can use: `me()`, `any()`, `NodeList`, `HTMLElement` (..or arrays of these!)
  * Get 1 element: `me()`
  * ..or many elements: `any()`
  * `me()` or `any()` can chain with any Surreal function.
    * `me()` can be used directly as a single element (like `querySelector()` or `$()`)
    * `any()` can use: `for` / `forEach` / `filter` / `map` (like `querySelectorAll()` or `$()`)
* 🌗 No forced style. Use: `classAdd` or `class_add` or `addClass` or `add_class`
  * Use `camelCase` (Javascript) or `snake_case` (Python, Rust, PHP, Ruby, SQL, CSS).

### 🤔 Why use `me()` / `any()` instead of `$()`
* 💡 Solves the classic jQuery bloat problem: Am I getting 1 element or an array of elements?
  * `me()` is guaranteed to return 1 element (or first found, or null).
  * `any()` is guaranteed to return an array (or empty array).
  * No more checks = write less code. Bonus: Reads more like self-documenting english.

## 👁️ How does it look?

Do surreal things with [Locality of Behavior](https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/) like:
```html
<label for="file-input" >
  <div class="uploader"></div>
  <script>
    me().on("dragover", ev => { halt(ev); me(ev).classAdd('.hover'); console.log("Files in drop zone.") })
    me().on("dragleave", ev => { halt(ev); me(ev).classRemove('.hover'); console.log("Files left drop zone.") })
    me().on("drop", ev => { halt(ev); me(ev).classRemove('.hover').classAdd('.loading'); me('#file-input').attribute('files', ev.dataTransfer.files); me('#form').send('change') })
  </script>
</label>
```

## 🎁 Install

Surreal is only 320 lines. No build step. No dependencies.

[📥 Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnat/surreal/main/surreal.js) into your project, and add `<script src="/surreal.js"></script>` in your `<head>`

Or, 🌐 via CDN: `<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/surreal/1.3.2/surreal.js"></script>`

## ⚡ Usage

### <a name="selectors"></a>🔍️ DOM Selection

* Select **one** element: `me(...)`
  * Can be any of:
    * CSS selector: `".button"`, `"#header"`, `"h1"`, `"body > .block"`
    * Variables: `body`, `e`, `some_element`
    * Events: `event.currentTarget` will be used.
    * Surreal selectors: `me()`,`any()`
    * Choose the start location in the DOM with the 2nd arg. (Default: `document`)
      * 🔥 `any('button', me('#header')).classAdd('red')`
        * Add `.red` to any `<button>` inside of `#header`
  * `me()` ⭐ Get parent element of `<script>` without a **.class** or **#id** !
  * `me("body")` Gets `<body>`
  * `me(".button")` Gets the first `<div class="button">...</div>`. To get all of them use `any()`
* Select **one or more** elements as an array: `any(...)`
  * Like `me()` but guaranteed to return an array (or empty array). 
  * `any(".foo")` ⭐ Get all matching elements.
  * Convert between arrays of elements and single elements: `any(me())`, `me(any(".something"))`
 
### 🔥 DOM Functions

* ♻️ All functions work on single elements or arrays of elements.
* 🔗 Start a chain using `me()` and `any()`
  * 🟢 Style A `me().classAdd('red')` ⭐ Chain style. Recommended!
  * 🟠 Style B: `classAdd(me(), 'red')`
* 🌐 Global conveniences help you write less code.
  * `globalsAdd()` will automatically warn you of any clobbering issues!
  * 💀🩸 If you want no conveniences, or are a masochist, delete `globalsAdd()`
    * 🟢 `me().classAdd('red')` becomes `surreal.me().classAdd('red')`
    * 🟠 `classAdd(me(), 'red')` becomes `surreal.classAdd(surreal.me(), 'red')`

See: [Quick Start](#quick-start) and [Reference](#reference) and [No Surreal Needed](#no-surreal)

## <a name="quick-start"></a>⚡ Quick Start

* Add a class
  * `me().classAdd('red')`
  * `any("button").classAdd('red')`
* Events
  * `me().on("click", ev => me(ev).fadeOut() )`
  * `any('button').on('click', ev => { me(ev).styles('color: red') })`
* Run functions over elements.
  * `any('button').run(_ => { alert(_) })`
* Styles / CSS
  * `me().styles('color: red')`
  * `me().styles({ 'color':'red', 'background':'blue' })`
* Attributes
  * `me().attribute('active', true)`

  * Alternatives:
    * Skip missing elements using `?.` example: `me("video")?.requestFullscreen()`
    * Place `<script>` after the loaded element.
      * See `me('-')` / `me('prev')`
* 🔌 `fadeOut`

  * See below

### <a name="plugin-included"></a>🔌 Built-in Plugins

### Effects
Build effects with `me().styles({...})` with timelines using [CSS transitioned `await` or callbacks](#timelines).

Common effects included:

* 🔗 `fadeOut` 🌗 `fade_out`
  * Fade out and remove element.
  * Keep element with `remove=false`.
  * 🔥 `me().fadeOut()`
  * 🔥 `me().fadeOut(ev => { alert("Faded out!") }, 3000)` Over 3 seconds then call function.

* 🔗 `fadeIn` 🌗 `fade_in`
  * Fade in existing element which has `opacity: 0`
  * 🔥 `me().fadeIn()`
  * 🔥 `me().fadeIn(ev => { alert("Faded in!") }, 3000)` Over 3 seconds then call function.


## <a name="no-surreal"></a>⚪ No Surreal Needed

More often than not, Vanilla JS is the easiest way!

Logging
* 🔥 `console.log()` `console.warn()` `console.error()`
* Event logging: 🔥 `monitorEvents(me())` See: [Chrome Blog](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/quickly-monitor-events-from-the-console-panel-2/)

Benchmarking / Time It!
* 🔥 `console.time('name')`
* 🔥 `console.timeEnd('name')`

Text / HTML Content
* 🔥 `me().textContent = "hello world"`
  * XSS Safe! See: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent)
* 🔥 `me().innerHTML = "<p>hello world</p>"`
* 🔥 `me().innerText = "hello world"`

Children
* 🔥 `me().children`
* 🔥 `me().children.hidden = true`

Append / Prepend elements.
* 🔥 `me().prepend(new_element)`
* 🔥 `me().appendChild(new_element)`
* 🔥 `me().insertBefore(element, other_element.firstChild)`
* 🔥 `me().insertAdjacentHTML("beforebegin", new_element)`

AJAX (replace jQuery `ajax()`)
* Use [htmx](https://htmx.org/) or [htmz](https://leanrada.com/htmz/) or [fetch()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) or [XMLHttpRequest()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest)
* Example using `fetch()`
```js
me().on("click", async event => {
  let e = me(event)
  // EXAMPLE 1: Hit an endpoint.
  if((await fetch("/webhook")).ok) console.log("Did the thing.")
  // EXAMPLE 2: Get content and replace me()
  try {
    let response = await fetch('/endpoint')
    if (response.ok) e.innerHTML = await response.text()
    else console.warn('fetch(): Bad response')
  }
  catch (error) { console.warn(`fetch(): ${error}`) }
})
```
* Example using `XMLHttpRequest()`
```js
me().on("click", async event => {
  let e = me(event)
  // EXAMPLE 1: Hit an endpoint.
  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest()
  xhr.open("GET", "/webhook")
  xhr.send()
  // EXAMPLE 2: Get content and replace me()
  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest()
  xhr.open("GET", "/endpoint")
  xhr.onreadystatechange = () => {
    if (xhr.readyState == 4 && xhr.status >= 200 && xhr.status < 300) e.innerHTML = xhr.responseText
  }
  xhr.send()
})
```

 ## 💎 Conventions & Tips

* Many ideas can be done in HTML / CSS (ex: dropdowns)
* `_` = for temporary or unused variables. Keep it short and sweet!
* `e`, `el`, `elt` = element
* `e`, `ev`, `evt` = event
* `f`, `fn` = function

#### Scope functions and variables inside `<script>`
  * ⭐ Use a block `{ let note = "hi"; function hey(text) { alert(text) }; me().on('click', ev => { hey(note) }) }`
    * `let` and `function` is scoped within `{ }`
  * ⭐ Use `me()`
    *  `me().hey = (text) => { alert(text) }`
    *  `me().on('click', (ev) => { me(ev).hey("hi") })`
  * ⭐ Use an event `me().on('click', ev => { /* add and call function here */ })`
  * Use an inline module: `<script type="module">`
    * Note: `me()` in modules will not see `parentElement`, explicit selectors are required: `me(".mybutton")`

#### Select a void element like `<input type="text" />`
* Use: `me('-')` or `me('prev')` or `me('previous')`
  * 🔥 `<input type="text" /> <script>me('-').value = "hello"</script>`
  * Inspired by the CSS "next sibling" combinator `+` but in reverse `-`
* Or, use a relative start.
  * 🔥 `<form> <input type="text" n1 /> <script>me('[n1]', me()).value = "hello"</script> </form>`

#### Ignore call chain when element is missing.
* 🔥 `me("#i_dont_exist")?.classAdd('active')`
* No warnings: 🔥 `me("#i_dont_exist", document, false)?.classAdd('active')`

## <a name="plugins"></a>🔌 Your own plugin

Feel free to edit Surreal directly- but if you prefer, you can use plugins to effortlessly merge with new versions.

```javascript
function pluginHello(e) {
  function hello(e, name="World") {
    console.log(`Hello ${name} from ${e}`)
    return e // Make chainable.
  }
  // Add sugar
  e.hello = (name) => { return hello(e, name) }
}

surreal.plugins.push(pluginHello)
```

Now use your function like: `me().hello("Internet")`

* See the included `pluginEffects` for a more comprehensive example.
* Your functions are added globally by `globalsAdd()` If you do not want this, add it to the `restricted` list.
* Refer to an existing function to see how to make yours work with 1 or many elements.

Make an [issue](https://github.com/gnat/surreal/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/gnat/surreal/pulls) if you think people would like to use it! If it's useful enough we'll want it in core.

## Why does this exist?

* You want an easy inline vanilla CSS experience without Tailwind CSS.
* Hate creating unique class names over.. and over.. to use once.
* You want to co-locate your styles for ⚡️ [Locality of Behavior (LoB)](https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/)
* You wish `this` would work in `<style>` tags.
* Want all CSS features: [Nesting](https://caniuse.com/css-nesting), animations. Get scoped [`@keyframes`](https://github.com/gnat/css-scope-inline/blob/main/example.html#L50)!
* You wish `@media` queries were shorter for [responsive design](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design).
* Only 16 lines. No build step. No dependencies.
* Pairs well with [htmx](https://htmx.org) and [Surreal](https://github.com/gnat/surreal)
* Want fewer layers, less complexity. Are aware of the cargo cult. ✈️

✨ Want to also scope your `<script>` tags? See our companion project [Surreal](https://github.com/gnat/surreal)

## 👁️ How does it look?
```html
<div>
    <style>
        me { background: red; } /* ✨ this & self also work! */
        me button { background: blue; } /* style child elements inline! */
    </style>
    <button>I'm blue</button>
</div>
```
See the [Live Example](https://gnat.github.io/css-scope-inline/example.html)! Then [view source](https://github.com/gnat/css-scope-inline/blob/main/example.html).

## 🌘 How does it work?

This uses `MutationObserver` to monitor the DOM, and the moment a `<style>` tag is seen, it scopes the styles to whatever the parent element is. No flashing or popping. 

This method also leaves your existing styles untouched, allowing you to mix and match at your leisure.

## 🤔 Why consider this over Tailwind CSS?

Use whatever you'd like, but there's a few advantages with this approach over Tailwind, Twind, UnoCSS:

* No [repeated styles](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/reusing-styles) on child elements (..no [@apply](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/reusing-styles#extracting-classes-with-apply), no `[&>thing]` on each style).
* No repeated prefixes for media queries, hover, focus, etc.
* No visual noise on every `<div>`. Use a local `<style>` per group.
* Share syntax between local and external styles. It's just CSS.
* Regain your "inspect, play with styles, paste" workflow in your web browser!
* No suffering from lost syntax highlighting on properties and units.
* No high risk of eventually requiring a build step.
* No chance of [deprecations](https://windicss.org/posts/sunsetting.html). 16 lines is infinitely maintainable.
* No suffering from FOUC (a flash of unstyled content).
* Zero friction movement of styles between inline and `.css` files. Just replace `me`
* No special tooling or plugins to install.

## ⚡ Workflow Tips

* Flat, 1 selector per line can be very short like Tailwind. See the examples.
* Use just plain CSS variables in your design system.
* Use the short `@media` queries for responsive design.
  * Mobile First (flow: **above** breakpoint): **🟢 None (xs)** `sm` `md` `lg` `xl` `xx` 🏁
  * Desktop First (flow: **below** breakpoint): 🏁 `xs-` `sm-` `md-` `lg-` `xl-` **🟢 None (xx)**
  * 🟢 = No breakpoint. Default. See the [Live Example](https://gnat.github.io/css-scope-inline/example.html)!
  * Based on [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design) breakpoints. We use `xx` not `2xl` to not break CSS highlighters.
  * Unlike Tailwind, you can [nest your @media styles](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/css-nesting/#nesting-media)!
* Positional selectors may be easier using `div[n1]` for `<div n1>` instead of `div:nth-child(1)`
* Try tools like- Auto complete styles: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Emmet)

## 👁️ CSS Scope Inline vs Tailwind CSS Showdowns
### Basics
Tailwind verbosity goes up with more child elements.
```html
<div>
    <style>
        me { background: red; }
        me div { background: green; }
        me [n1] { background: yellow; }
        me [n2] { background: blue; }
    </style>
    red
    <div>green</div>
    <div>green</div>
    <div>green</div>
    <div n1>yellow</div>
    <div n2>blue</div>
    <div>green</div>
    <div>green</div>
</div>

<div class="bg-[red]">
    red
    <div class="bg-[green]">green</div>
    <div class="bg-[green]">green</div>
    <div class="bg-[green]">green</div>
    <div class="bg-[yellow]">yellow</div>
    <div class="bg-[blue]">blue</div>
    <div class="bg-[green]">green</div>
    <div class="bg-[green]">green</div>
</div>
```

### CSS variables and child elements
At first glance, **Tailwind Example 2** looks very promising! Exciting ...but:
* 🔴 **Every child style requires an explicit selector.**
  * Tailwinds' shorthand advantages sadly disappear.
  * Any more child styles added in Tailwind will become longer than vanilla CSS.
  * This limited example is the best case scenario for Tailwind.
* 🔴 Not visible on github: **no highlighting for properties and units** begins to be painful.

## 🔎 Technical FAQ
* Why do you use `querySelectorAll()` and not just process the `MutationObserver` results directly?
  * This was indeed the original design; it will work well up until you begin recieving subtrees (ex: DOM swaps with [htmx](https://htmx.org), ajax, jquery, etc.) which requires walking all subtree elements to ensure we do not miss a `<style>`. This unfortunately involves re-scanning thousands of repeated elements. This is why `querySelectorAll()` ends up the performance (and simplicity) winner.</doc><doc title="Starlette quick guide" desc="A quick overview of some Starlette features useful to FastHTML devs."># 🌟 Starlette Quick Manual


2020-02-09

Starlette is the ASGI web framework used as the foundation of FastHTML. Listed here are some Starlette features FastHTML developers can use directly, since the `FastHTML` class inherits from the `Starlette` class (but note that FastHTML has its own customised `RouteX` and `RouterX` classes for routing, to handle FT element trees etc).

## Get uploaded file content

```
async def handler(request):
    inp = await request.form()
    uploaded_file = inp["filename"]
    filename = uploaded_file.filename           # abc.png
    content_type = uploaded.content_type    # MIME type, e.g. image/png
    content = await uploaded_file.read()       # image content

```

## Return a customized response (status code and headers)

```
import json
from starlette.responses import Response

async def handler(request):
    data = {
        "name": "Bo"
    }
    return Response(json.dumps(data), media_type="application/json")

```

`Response` takes `status_code`, `headers` and `media_type`, so if we want to change a response's status code, we can do:

```
return Response(content, statu_code=404)

```

And customized headers:

```
headers = {
	"x-extra-key": "value"
}
return Response(content, status_code=200, headers=headers)

```

## Redirect

```
from starlette.responses import RedirectResponse

async handler(request):
    # Customize status_code: 
    #   301: permanent redirect 
    #   302: temporary redirect 
    #   303: see others
    #   307: temporary redirect (default)
    return RedirectResponse(url=url, status_code=303)

```

## Request context

### URL Object: `request.url`

  * Get request full url: `url = str(request.url)`
  * Get scheme: `request.url.scheme` (http, https, ws, wss)
  * Get netloc: `request.url.netloc`, e.g.: example.com:8080
  * Get path: `request.url.path`, e.g.: /search
  * Get query string: `request.url.query`, e.g.: kw=hello
  * Get hostname: `request.url.hostname`, e.g.: example.com
  * Get port: `request.url.port`, e.g.: 8080
  * If using secure scheme: `request.url.is_secure`, True is schme is `https` or `wss`

### Headers: `request.headers`

```
{
    'host': 'example.com:8080', 
    'connection': 'keep-alive', 
    'cache-control': 'max-age=0', 
    'sec-ch-ua': 'Google Chrome 80', 
    'dnt': '1', 
    'upgrade-insecure-requests': '1', 
    'user-agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_3) ...',
    'sec-fetch-dest': 'document', 
    'accept': 'text/html,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8;v=b3;q=0.9', 
    'sec-origin-policy': '0', 
    'sec-fetch-site': 'none', 
    'sec-fetch-mode': 'navigate', 
    'sec-fetch-user': '?1', 
    'accept-encoding': 'gzip, deflate, br', 
    'accept-language': 'en-US,en;q=0.9,zh-CN;q=0.8,zh;q=0.7,zh-TW;q=0.6', 
    'cookie': 'session=eyJhZG1pbl91c2_KiQ...'
}

```

### Client: `request.client`

  * `request.client.host`: get client sock IP
  * `request.client.port`: get client sock port

### Method: `request.method`

  * `request.method`: GET, POST, etc.

### Get Data

  * `await request.body()`: get raw data from body
  * `await request.json()`: get passed data and parse it as JSON
  * `await request.form()`: get posted data and pass it as dictionary

### Scope: `request.scope`

```
{
    'type': 'http', 
    'http_version': '1.1', 
    'server': ('127.0.0.1', 9092), 
    'client': ('127.0.0.1', 53102), 
    'scheme': 'https', 
    'method': 'GET', 
    'root_path': '', 
    'path': '/', 
    'raw_path': b'/', 
    'query_string': b'kw=hello', 
    'headers': [
        (b'host', b'example.com:8080'), 
        (b'connection', b'keep-alive'), 
        (b'cache-control', b'max-age=0'), 
        ...
    ], 
    'app': <starlette.applications.Starlette object at 0x1081bd650>, 
    'session': {'uid': '57ba03ea7333f72a25f837cf'}, 
    'router': <starlette.routing.Router object at 0x1081bd6d0>, 
    'endpoint': <class 'app.index.Index'>, 
    'path_params': {}
}

```

## Put varaible in request & app scope

```
app.state.dbconn = get_db_conn()
request.state.start_time = time.time()
# use app-scope state variable in a request
request.app.state.dbconn

```

## Utility functions

### Use `State` to wrap a dictionary

```
from starlette.datastructures import State

data = {
    "name": "Bo"
}
print(data["name"])
# now wrap it with State function
wrapped = State(data)
# You can use the dot syntaxt, but can't use `wrapped["name"]` any more.
print(wrapped.name)

```

### login_required wrapper function

NB: This is easier to do in FastHTML using Beforeware.

```
import functools
from starlette.endpoints import HTTPEndpoint
from starlette.responses import Response

def login_required(login_url="/signin"):
    def decorator(handler):
        @functools.wraps(handler)
        async def new_handler(obj, req, *args, **kwargs):
            user = req.session.get("login_user")
            if user is None:
                return seeother(login_url)
            return await handler(obj, req, *args, **kwargs)
        return new_handler
    return decorator

class MyAccount(HTTPEndpiont):
    @login_required()
    async def get(self, request):
        # some logic here
        content = "hello"
        return Response(content)

```

## Exceptions

Handle exception and customize 403, 404, 503, 500 page:

```
from starlette.exceptions import HTTPException

async def exc_handle_403(request, exc):
    return HTMLResponse("My 403 page", status_code=exc.status_code)

async def exc_handle_404(request, exc):
    return HTMLResponse("My 404 page", status_code=exc.status_code)

async def exc_handle_503(request, exc):
    return HTMLResponse("Failed, please try it later", status_code=exc.status_code)

# error is not exception, 500 is server side unexpected error, all other status code will be treated as Exception
async def err_handle_500(request, exc):
    import traceback
    Log.error(traceback.format_exc())
    return HTMLResponse("My 500 page", status_code=500)

# To add handler, we can add either status_code or Exception itself as key
exception_handlers = {
    403: exc_handle_403,
    404: exc_handle_404,
    503: exc_handle_503,
    500: err_handle_500,
    #HTTPException: exc_handle_500,
}

app = Starlette(routes=routes, exception_handlers=exception_handlers)

```

## Background Task

### Put some async task as background task

```
import aiofiles
from starlette.background import BackgroundTask
from starlette.responses import Response

aiofiles_remove = aiofiles.os.wrap(os.remove)

async def del_file(fpath):
    await aiofiles_remove(fpath)

async def handler(request):
    content = ""
    fpath = "/tmp/tmpfile.txt"
    task = BackgroundTask(del_file, fpath=fpath)
    return Response(content, background=task)

```

### Put multiple tasks as background task

```
from starlette.background import BackgroundTasks

async def task1(name):
    pass

async def task2(email):
    pass

async def handler(request):
    tasks = BackgroundTasks()
    tasks.add_task(task1, name="John")
    tasks.add_task(task2, email="info@example.com")
    content = ""
    return Response(content, background=tasks)

```

## Write middleware

There are 2 ways to write middleware:

### Define `__call__` function:

```
class MyMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, app):
        self.app = app

    async def __call__(self, scope, receive, send):
        # see above scope dictionary as reference
        headers = dict(scope["headers"])
        # do something
        # pass to next middleware
        return await self.app(scope, receive, send)

```

### Use `BaseHTTPMiddleware`

```
from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware

class CustomHeaderMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    async def dispatch(self, request, call_next):
        # do something before pass to next middleware
        response = await call_next(request)
        # do something after next middleware returned
        response.headers['X-Author'] = 'John'
        return response

## fasthtml.live_reload

- `class FastHTMLWithLiveReload`
    `FastHTMLWithLiveReload` enables live reloading.
    This means that any code changes saved on the server will automatically
    trigger a reload of both the server and browser window.

    How does it work?
      - a websocket is created at `/live-reload`
      - a small js snippet `LIVE_RELOAD_SCRIPT` is injected into each webpage
      - this snippet connects to the websocket at `/live-reload` and listens for an `onclose` event
      - when the `onclose` event is detected the browser is reloaded

    Why do we listen for an `onclose` event?
      When code changes are saved the server automatically reloads if the --reload flag is set.
      The server reload kills the websocket connection. The `onclose` event serves as a proxy
      for "developer has saved some changes".

    # HTMX by default replaces the inner HTML of the calling element, which in this case is the todo list form.
    # Therefore, we return the list of todos, now in the correct order, which will be auto-converted to FT for us.
    # In this case, it's not strictly necessary, because sortable.js has already reorder the DOM elements.
    # However, by returning the updated data, we can be assured that there aren't sync issues between the DOM
    # and the server.
    return tuple(todos(order_by='priority'))

# Refactoring components in FastHTML is as simple as creating Python functions.
# The `clr_details` function creates a Div with specific HTMX attributes.
# `hx_swap_oob='innerHTML'` tells HTMX to swap the inner HTML of the target element out-of-band,
# meaning it will update this element regardless of where the HTMX request originated from.
def clr_details(): return Div(hx_swap_oob='innerHTML', id='current-todo')

# This route handler uses a path parameter `{id}` which is automatically parsed and passed as an int.
@rt("/todos/{id}")
def delete(id:int):
    # The `delete` method is part of the MiniDataAPI spec, removing the item with the given primary key.
    todos.delete(id)
    # Returning `clr_details()` ensures the details view is cleared after deletion,
    # leveraging HTMX's out-of-band swap feature.
    # Note that we are not returning *any* FT component that doesn't have an "OOB" swap, so the target element
    # inner HTML is simply deleted. That's why the deleted todo is removed from the list.
    return clr_details()

@rt("/edit/{id}")
def get(id:int):
    # The `hx_put` attribute tells HTMX to send a PUT request when the form is submitted.
    # `target_id` specifies which element will be updated with the server's response.
    res = Form(Group(Input(id="title"), Button("Save")),
        Hidden(id="id"), CheckboxX(id="done", label='Done'),
        Textarea(id="details", name="details", rows=10),
        hx_put="/", target_id=f'todo-{id}', id="edit")
    # `fill_form` populates the form with existing todo data, and returns the result.
    # Indexing into a table (`todos`) queries by primary key, which is `id` here. It also includes
    # `xtra`, so this will only return the id if it belongs to the current user.
    return fill_form(res, todos[id])

@rt("/")
def put(todo: Todo):
    # `update` is part of the MiniDataAPI spec.
    # Note that the updated todo is returned. By returning the updated todo, we can update the list directly.
    # Because we return a tuple with `clr_details()`, the details view is also cleared.
    return todos.update(todo), clr_details()

@rt("/")
def post(todo:Todo):
    # `hx_swap_oob='true'` tells HTMX to perform an out-of-band swap, updating this element wherever it appears.
    # This is used to clear the input field after adding the new todo.
    new_inp =  Input(id="new-title", name="title", placeholder="New Todo", hx_swap_oob='true')
    # `insert` returns the inserted todo, which is appended to the start of the list, because we used
    # `hx_swap='afterbegin'` when creating the todo list form.
    return todos.insert(todo), new_inp

@rt("/todos/{id}")
def get(id:int):
    todo = todos[id]
    # `hx_swap` determines how the update should occur. We use "outerHTML" to replace the entire todo `Li` element.
    btn = Button('delete', hx_delete=f'/todos/{todo.id}',
                 target_id=f'todo-{todo.id}', hx_swap="outerHTML")
    # The "markdown" class is used here because that's the CSS selector we used in the JS earlier.
    # Therefore this will trigger the JS to parse the markdown in the details field.
    # Because `class` is a reserved keyword in Python, we use `cls` instead, which FastHTML auto-converts.
    return Div(H2(todo.title), Div(todo.details, cls="markdown"), btn)

# Starlette Introduction

Starlette is a lightweight [ASGI][asgi] framework/toolkit,
which is ideal for building async web services in Python.

It is production-ready, and gives you the following:

* A lightweight, low-complexity HTTP web framework.
* WebSocket support.
* In-process background tasks.
* Startup and shutdown events.
* Test client built on `httpx`.
* CORS, GZip, Static Files, Streaming responses.
* Session and Cookie support.
* 100% test coverage.
* 100% type annotated codebase.
* Few hard dependencies.
* Compatible with `asyncio` and `trio` backends.
* Great overall performance [against independent benchmarks][techempower].

## Requirements

Python 3.8+

## Installation

```shell
$ pip3 install starlette
```

You'll also want to install an ASGI server, such as [uvicorn](http://www.uvicorn.org/), [daphne](https://github.com/django/daphne/), or [hypercorn](https://pgjones.gitlab.io/hypercorn/).

```shell
$ pip3 install uvicorn
```

## Example

**example.py**:

```python
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.responses import JSONResponse
from starlette.routing import Route


async def homepage(request):
    return JSONResponse({'hello': 'world'})


app = Starlette(debug=True, routes=[
    Route('/', homepage),
])
```

Then run the application...

```shell
$ uvicorn example:app
```

For a more complete example, [see here](https://github.com/encode/starlette-example).

## Dependencies

Starlette only requires `anyio`, and the following dependencies are optional:

* [`httpx`][httpx] - Required if you want to use the `TestClient`.
* [`jinja2`][jinja2] - Required if you want to use `Jinja2Templates`.
* [`python-multipart`][python-multipart] - Required if you want to support form parsing, with `request.form()`.
* [`itsdangerous`][itsdangerous] - Required for `SessionMiddleware` support.
* [`pyyaml`][pyyaml] - Required for `SchemaGenerator` support.

You can install all of these with `pip3 install starlette[full]`.

## Framework or Toolkit

Starlette is designed to be used either as a complete framework, or as
an ASGI toolkit. You can use any of its components independently.

```python
from starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse


async def app(scope, receive, send):
    assert scope['type'] == 'http'
    response = PlainTextResponse('Hello, world!')
    await response(scope, receive, send)
```

Run the `app` application in `example.py`:

```shell
$ uvicorn example:app
INFO: Started server process [11509]
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Run uvicorn with `--reload` to enable auto-reloading on code changes.

## Modularity

The modularity that Starlette is designed on promotes building re-usable
components that can be shared between any ASGI framework. This should enable
an ecosystem of shared middleware and mountable applications.

The clean API separation also means it's easier to understand each component
in isolation.

---

# applications.md

Starlette includes an application class `Starlette` that nicely ties together all of
its other functionality.

```python
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse
from starlette.routing import Route, Mount, WebSocketRoute
from starlette.staticfiles import StaticFiles


def homepage(request):
    return PlainTextResponse('Hello, world!')

def user_me(request):
    username = "John Doe"
    return PlainTextResponse('Hello, %s!' % username)

def user(request):
    username = request.path_params['username']
    return PlainTextResponse('Hello, %s!' % username)

async def websocket_endpoint(websocket):
    await websocket.accept()
    await websocket.send_text('Hello, websocket!')
    await websocket.close()

def startup():
    print('Ready to go')


routes = [
    Route('/', homepage),
    Route('/user/me', user_me),
    Route('/user/{username}', user),
    WebSocketRoute('/ws', websocket_endpoint),
    Mount('/static', StaticFiles(directory="static")),
]

app = Starlette(debug=True, routes=routes, on_startup=[startup])
```

### Instantiating the application

::: starlette.applications.Starlette
    :docstring:

### Storing state on the app instance

You can store arbitrary extra state on the application instance, using the
generic `app.state` attribute.

For example:

```python
app.state.ADMIN_EMAIL = 'admin@example.org'
```

### Accessing the app instance

Where a `request` is available (i.e. endpoints and middleware), the app is available on `request.app`.


# requests.md


Starlette includes a `Request` class that gives you a nicer interface onto
the incoming request, rather than accessing the ASGI scope and receive channel directly.

### Request

Signature: `Request(scope, receive=None)`

```python
from starlette.requests import Request
from starlette.responses import Response


async def app(scope, receive, send):
    assert scope['type'] == 'http'
    request = Request(scope, receive)
    content = '%s %s' % (request.method, request.url.path)
    response = Response(content, media_type='text/plain')
    await response(scope, receive, send)
```

Requests present a mapping interface, so you can use them in the same
way as a `scope`.

For instance: `request['path']` will return the ASGI path.

If you don't need to access the request body you can instantiate a request
without providing an argument to `receive`.

#### Method

The request method is accessed as `request.method`.

#### URL

The request URL is accessed as `request.url`.

The property is a string-like object that exposes all the
components that can be parsed out of the URL.

For example: `request.url.path`, `request.url.port`, `request.url.scheme`.

#### Headers

Headers are exposed as an immutable, case-insensitive, multi-dict.

For example: `request.headers['content-type']`

#### Query Parameters

Query parameters are exposed as an immutable multi-dict.

For example: `request.query_params['search']`

#### Path Parameters

Router path parameters are exposed as a dictionary interface.

For example: `request.path_params['username']`

#### Client Address

The client's remote address is exposed as a named two-tuple `request.client` (or `None`).

The hostname or IP address: `request.client.host`

The port number from which the client is connecting: `request.client.port`

#### Cookies

Cookies are exposed as a regular dictionary interface.

For example: `request.cookies.get('mycookie')`

Cookies are ignored in case of an invalid cookie. (RFC2109)

#### Body

There are a few different interfaces for returning the body of the request:

The request body as bytes: `await request.body()`

The request body, parsed as form data or multipart: `async with request.form() as form:`

The request body, parsed as JSON: `await request.json()`

You can also access the request body as a stream, using the `async for` syntax:

```python
from starlette.requests import Request
from starlette.responses import Response

    
async def app(scope, receive, send):
    assert scope['type'] == 'http'
    request = Request(scope, receive)
    body = b''
    async for chunk in request.stream():
        body += chunk
    response = Response(body, media_type='text/plain')
    await response(scope, receive, send)
```

If you access `.stream()` then the byte chunks are provided without storing
the entire body to memory. Any subsequent calls to `.body()`, `.form()`, or `.json()`
will raise an error.

In some cases such as long-polling, or streaming responses you might need to
determine if the client has dropped the connection. You can determine this
state with `disconnected = await request.is_disconnected()`.

#### Request Files

Request files are normally sent as multipart form data (`multipart/form-data`).

Signature: `request.form(max_files=1000, max_fields=1000)`

You can configure the number of maximum fields or files with the parameters `max_files` and `max_fields`:

```python
async with request.form(max_files=1000, max_fields=1000):
    ...
```

!!! info
    These limits are for security reasons, allowing an unlimited number of fields or files could lead to a denial of service attack by consuming a lot of CPU and memory parsing too many empty fields.

When you call `async with request.form() as form` you receive a `starlette.datastructures.FormData` which is an immutable
multidict, containing both file uploads and text input. File upload items are represented as instances of `starlette.datastructures.UploadFile`.

`UploadFile` has the following attributes:

* `filename`: An `str` with the original file name that was uploaded or `None` if its not available (e.g. `myimage.jpg`).
* `content_type`: An `str` with the content type (MIME type / media type) or `None` if it's not available (e.g. `image/jpeg`).
* `file`: A <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.SpooledTemporaryFile" target="_blank">`SpooledTemporaryFile`</a> (a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-like-object" target="_blank">file-like</a> object). This is the actual Python file that you can pass directly to other functions or libraries that expect a "file-like" object.
* `headers`: A `Headers` object. Often this will only be the `Content-Type` header, but if additional headers were included in the multipart field they will be included here. Note that these headers have no relationship with the headers in `Request.headers`.
* `size`: An `int` with uploaded file's size in bytes. This value is calculated from request's contents, making it better choice to find uploaded file's size than `Content-Length` header. `None` if not set.

`UploadFile` has the following `async` methods. They all call the corresponding file methods underneath (using the internal `SpooledTemporaryFile`).

* `async write(data)`: Writes `data` (`bytes`) to the file.
* `async read(size)`: Reads `size` (`int`) bytes of the file.
* `async seek(offset)`: Goes to the byte position `offset` (`int`) in the file.
    * E.g., `await myfile.seek(0)` would go to the start of the file.
* `async close()`: Closes the file.

As all these methods are `async` methods, you need to "await" them.

For example, you can get the file name and the contents with:

```python
async with request.form() as form:
    filename = form["upload_file"].filename
    contents = await form["upload_file"].read()
```

!!! info
    As settled in [RFC-7578: 4.2](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7578.txt), form-data content part that contains file 
    assumed to have `name` and `filename` fields in `Content-Disposition` header: `Content-Disposition: form-data;
    name="user"; filename="somefile"`. Though `filename` field is optional according to RFC-7578, it helps 
    Starlette to differentiate which data should be treated as file. If `filename` field was supplied, `UploadFile` 
    object will be created to access underlying file, otherwise form-data part will be parsed and available as a raw 
    string.

#### Application

The originating Starlette application can be accessed via `request.app`.

#### Other state

If you want to store additional information on the request you can do so
using `request.state`.

For example:

`request.state.time_started = time.time()`


# responses.md


Starlette includes a few response classes that handle sending back the
appropriate ASGI messages on the `send` channel.

### Response

Signature: `Response(content, status_code=200, headers=None, media_type=None)`

* `content` - A string or bytestring.
* `status_code` - An integer HTTP status code.
* `headers` - A dictionary of strings.
* `media_type` - A string giving the media type. eg. "text/html"

Starlette will automatically include a Content-Length header. It will also
include a Content-Type header, based on the media_type and appending a charset
for text types, unless a charset has already been specified in the `media_type`.

Once you've instantiated a response, you can send it by calling it as an
ASGI application instance.

```python
from starlette.responses import Response


async def app(scope, receive, send):
    assert scope['type'] == 'http'
    response = Response('Hello, world!', media_type='text/plain')
    await response(scope, receive, send)
```
#### Set Cookie

Starlette provides a `set_cookie` method to allow you to set cookies on the response object.

Signature: `Response.set_cookie(key, value, max_age=None, expires=None, path="/", domain=None, secure=False, httponly=False, samesite="lax")`

* `key` - A string that will be the cookie's key.
* `value` - A string that will be the cookie's value.
* `max_age` - An integer that defines the lifetime of the cookie in seconds. A negative integer or a value of `0` will discard the cookie immediately. `Optional`
* `expires` - Either an integer that defines the number of seconds until the cookie expires, or a datetime. `Optional`
* `path` - A string that specifies the subset of routes to which the cookie will apply. `Optional`
* `domain` - A string that specifies the domain for which the cookie is valid. `Optional`
* `secure` - A bool indicating that the cookie will only be sent to the server if request is made using SSL and the HTTPS protocol. `Optional`
* `httponly` - A bool indicating that the cookie cannot be accessed via JavaScript through `Document.cookie` property, the `XMLHttpRequest` or `Request` APIs. `Optional`
* `samesite` - A string that specifies the samesite strategy for the cookie. Valid values are `'lax'`, `'strict'` and `'none'`. Defaults to `'lax'`. `Optional`

#### Delete Cookie

Conversely, Starlette also provides a `delete_cookie` method to manually expire a set cookie.

Signature: `Response.delete_cookie(key, path='/', domain=None)`


### HTMLResponse

Takes some text or bytes and returns an HTML response.

```python
from starlette.responses import HTMLResponse


async def app(scope, receive, send):
    assert scope['type'] == 'http'
    response = HTMLResponse('<html><body><h1>Hello, world!</h1></body></html>')
    await response(scope, receive, send)
```

### PlainTextResponse

Takes some text or bytes and returns a plain text response.

```python
from starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse


async def app(scope, receive, send):
    assert scope['type'] == 'http'
    response = PlainTextResponse('Hello, world!')
    await response(scope, receive, send)
```

### JSONResponse

Takes some data and returns an `application/json` encoded response.

```python
from starlette.responses import JSONResponse


async def app(scope, receive, send):
    assert scope['type'] == 'http'
    response = JSONResponse({'hello': 'world'})
    await response(scope, receive, send)
```

#### Custom JSON serialization

If you need fine-grained control over JSON serialization, you can subclass
`JSONResponse` and override the `render` method.

For example, if you wanted to use a third-party JSON library such as
[orjson](https://pypi.org/project/orjson/):

```python
from typing import Any

import orjson
from starlette.responses import JSONResponse


class OrjsonResponse(JSONResponse):
    def render(self, content: Any) -> bytes:
        return orjson.dumps(content)
```

In general you *probably* want to stick with `JSONResponse` by default unless
you are micro-optimising a particular endpoint or need to serialize non-standard
object types.

### RedirectResponse

Returns an HTTP redirect. Uses a 307 status code by default.

```python
from starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse, RedirectResponse


async def app(scope, receive, send):
    assert scope['type'] == 'http'
    if scope['path'] != '/':
        response = RedirectResponse(url='/')
    else:
        response = PlainTextResponse('Hello, world!')
    await response(scope, receive, send)
```

### StreamingResponse

Takes an async generator or a normal generator/iterator and streams the response body.

```python
from starlette.responses import StreamingResponse
import asyncio


async def slow_numbers(minimum, maximum):
    yield '<html><body><ul>'
    for number in range(minimum, maximum + 1):
        yield '<li>%d</li>' % number
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
    yield '</ul></body></html>'


async def app(scope, receive, send):
    assert scope['type'] == 'http'
    generator = slow_numbers(1, 10)
    response = StreamingResponse(generator, media_type='text/html')
    await response(scope, receive, send)
```

Have in mind that <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-like-object" target="_blank">file-like</a> objects (like those created by `open()`) are normal iterators. So, you can return them directly in a `StreamingResponse`.

### FileResponse

Asynchronously streams a file as the response.

Takes a different set of arguments to instantiate than the other response types:

* `path` - The filepath to the file to stream.
* `headers` - Any custom headers to include, as a dictionary.
* `media_type` - A string giving the media type. If unset, the filename or path will be used to infer a media type.
* `filename` - If set, this will be included in the response `Content-Disposition`.
* `content_disposition_type` - will be included in the response `Content-Disposition`. Can be set to "attachment" (default) or "inline".

File responses will include appropriate `Content-Length`, `Last-Modified` and `ETag` headers.

```python
from starlette.responses import FileResponse


async def app(scope, receive, send):
    assert scope['type'] == 'http'
    response = FileResponse('statics/favicon.ico')
    await response(scope, receive, send)
```

## Third party responses

#### [EventSourceResponse](https://github.com/sysid/sse-starlette)

A response class that implements [Server-Sent Events](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html). It enables event streaming from the server to the client without the complexity of websockets.

#### [baize.asgi.FileResponse](https://baize.aber.sh/asgi#fileresponse)

As a smooth replacement for Starlette [`FileResponse`](https://www.starlette.io/responses/#fileresponse), it will automatically handle [Head method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/HEAD) and [Range requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests).


# websockets.md


Starlette includes a `WebSocket` class that fulfils a similar role
to the HTTP request, but that allows sending and receiving data on a websocket.

### WebSocket

Signature: `WebSocket(scope, receive=None, send=None)`

```python
from starlette.websockets import WebSocket


async def app(scope, receive, send):
    websocket = WebSocket(scope=scope, receive=receive, send=send)
    await websocket.accept()
    await websocket.send_text('Hello, world!')
    await websocket.close()
```

WebSockets present a mapping interface, so you can use them in the same
way as a `scope`.

For instance: `websocket['path']` will return the ASGI path.

#### URL

The websocket URL is accessed as `websocket.url`.

The property is actually a subclass of `str`, and also exposes all the
components that can be parsed out of the URL.

For example: `websocket.url.path`, `websocket.url.port`, `websocket.url.scheme`.

#### Headers

Headers are exposed as an immutable, case-insensitive, multi-dict.

For example: `websocket.headers['sec-websocket-version']`

#### Query Parameters

Query parameters are exposed as an immutable multi-dict.

For example: `websocket.query_params['search']`

#### Path Parameters

Router path parameters are exposed as a dictionary interface.

For example: `websocket.path_params['username']`

### Accepting the connection

* `await websocket.accept(subprotocol=None, headers=None)`

### Sending data

* `await websocket.send_text(data)`
* `await websocket.send_bytes(data)`
* `await websocket.send_json(data)`

JSON messages default to being sent over text data frames, from version 0.10.0 onwards.
Use `websocket.send_json(data, mode="binary")` to send JSON over binary data frames.

### Receiving data

* `await websocket.receive_text()`
* `await websocket.receive_bytes()`
* `await websocket.receive_json()`

May raise `starlette.websockets.WebSocketDisconnect()`.

JSON messages default to being received over text data frames, from version 0.10.0 onwards.
Use `websocket.receive_json(data, mode="binary")` to receive JSON over binary data frames.

### Iterating data

* `websocket.iter_text()`
* `websocket.iter_bytes()`
* `websocket.iter_json()`

Similar to `receive_text`, `receive_bytes`, and `receive_json` but returns an
async iterator.

```python hl_lines="7-8"
from starlette.websockets import WebSocket


async def app(scope, receive, send):
    websocket = WebSocket(scope=scope, receive=receive, send=send)
    await websocket.accept()
    async for message in websocket.iter_text():
        await websocket.send_text(f"Message text was: {message}")
    await websocket.close()
```

When `starlette.websockets.WebSocketDisconnect` is raised, the iterator will exit.

### Closing the connection

* `await websocket.close(code=1000, reason=None)`

### Sending and receiving messages

If you need to send or receive raw ASGI messages then you should use
`websocket.send()` and `websocket.receive()` rather than using the raw `send` and
`receive` callables. This will ensure that the websocket's state is kept
correctly updated.

* `await websocket.send(message)`
* `await websocket.receive()`

### Send Denial Response

If you call `websocket.close()` before calling `websocket.accept()` then
the server will automatically send a HTTP 403 error to the client.

If you want to send a different error response, you can use the
`websocket.send_denial_response()` method. This will send the response
and then close the connection.

* `await websocket.send_denial_response(response)`

This requires the ASGI server to support the WebSocket Denial Response
extension. If it is not supported a `RuntimeError` will be raised.


# routing.md

## HTTP Routing

Starlette has a simple but capable request routing system. A routing table
is defined as a list of routes, and passed when instantiating the application.

```python
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse
from starlette.routing import Route


async def homepage(request):
    return PlainTextResponse("Homepage")

async def about(request):
    return PlainTextResponse("About")


routes = [
    Route("/", endpoint=homepage),
    Route("/about", endpoint=about),
]

app = Starlette(routes=routes)
```

The `endpoint` argument can be one of:

* A regular function or async function, which accepts a single `request`
argument and which should return a response.
* A class that implements the ASGI interface, such as Starlette's [HTTPEndpoint](endpoints.md#httpendpoint).

## Path Parameters

Paths can use URI templating style to capture path components.

```python
Route('/users/{username}', user)
```
By default this will capture characters up to the end of the path or the next `/`.

You can use convertors to modify what is captured. The available convertors are:

* `str` returns a string, and is the default.
* `int` returns a Python integer.
* `float` returns a Python float.
* `uuid` return a Python `uuid.UUID` instance.
* `path` returns the rest of the path, including any additional `/` characters.

Convertors are used by prefixing them with a colon, like so:

```python
Route('/users/{user_id:int}', user)
Route('/floating-point/{number:float}', floating_point)
Route('/uploaded/{rest_of_path:path}', uploaded)
```

If you need a different converter that is not defined, you can create your own.
See below an example on how to create a `datetime` convertor, and how to register it:

```python
from datetime import datetime

from starlette.convertors import Convertor, register_url_convertor


class DateTimeConvertor(Convertor):
    regex = "[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}T[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}(.[0-9]+)?"

    def convert(self, value: str) -> datetime:
        return datetime.strptime(value, "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S")

    def to_string(self, value: datetime) -> str:
        return value.strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S")

register_url_convertor("datetime", DateTimeConvertor())
```

After registering it, you'll be able to use it as:

```python
Route('/history/{date:datetime}', history)
```

Path parameters are made available in the request, as the `request.path_params`
dictionary.

```python
async def user(request):
    user_id = request.path_params['user_id']
    ...
```

## Handling HTTP methods

Routes can also specify which HTTP methods are handled by an endpoint:

```python
Route('/users/{user_id:int}', user, methods=["GET", "POST"])
```

By default function endpoints will only accept `GET` requests, unless specified.

## Submounting routes

In large applications you might find that you want to break out parts of the
routing table, based on a common path prefix.

```python
routes = [
    Route('/', homepage),
    Mount('/users', routes=[
        Route('/', users, methods=['GET', 'POST']),
        Route('/{username}', user),
    ])
]
```

This style allows you to define different subsets of the routing table in
different parts of your project.

```python
from myproject import users, auth

routes = [
    Route('/', homepage),
    Mount('/users', routes=users.routes),
    Mount('/auth', routes=auth.routes),
]
```

You can also use mounting to include sub-applications within your Starlette
application. For example...

```python
# This is a standalone static files server:
app = StaticFiles(directory="static")

# This is a static files server mounted within a Starlette application,
# underneath the "/static" path.
routes = [
    ...
    Mount("/static", app=StaticFiles(directory="static"), name="static")
]

app = Starlette(routes=routes)
```

## Reverse URL lookups

You'll often want to be able to generate the URL for a particular route,
such as in cases where you need to return a redirect response.

* Signature: `url_for(name, **path_params) -> URL`

```python
routes = [
    Route("/", homepage, name="homepage")
]

# We can use the following to return a URL...
url = request.url_for("homepage")
```

URL lookups can include path parameters...

```python
routes = [
    Route("/users/{username}", user, name="user_detail")
]

# We can use the following to return a URL...
url = request.url_for("user_detail", username=...)
```

If a `Mount` includes a `name`, then submounts should use a `{prefix}:{name}`
style for reverse URL lookups.

```python
routes = [
    Mount("/users", name="users", routes=[
        Route("/", user, name="user_list"),
        Route("/{username}", user, name="user_detail")
    ])
]

# We can use the following to return URLs...
url = request.url_for("users:user_list")
url = request.url_for("users:user_detail", username=...)
```

Mounted applications may include a `path=...` parameter.

```python
routes = [
    ...
    Mount("/static", app=StaticFiles(directory="static"), name="static")
]

# We can use the following to return URLs...
url = request.url_for("static", path="/css/base.css")
```

For cases where there is no `request` instance, you can make reverse lookups
against the application, although these will only return the URL path.

```python
url = app.url_path_for("user_detail", username=...)
```

## Host-based routing

If you want to use different routes for the same path based on the `Host` header.

Note that port is removed from the `Host` header when matching.
For example, `Host (host='example.org:3600', ...)` will be processed
even if the `Host` header contains or does not contain a port other than `3600`
(`example.org:5600`, `example.org`).
Therefore, you can specify the port if you need it for use in `url_for`.

There are several ways to connect host-based routes to your application

```python
site = Router()  # Use eg. `@site.route()` to configure this.
api = Router()  # Use eg. `@api.route()` to configure this.
news = Router()  # Use eg. `@news.route()` to configure this.

routes = [
    Host('api.example.org', api, name="site_api")
]

app = Starlette(routes=routes)

app.host('www.example.org', site, name="main_site")

news_host = Host('news.example.org', news)
app.router.routes.append(news_host)
```

URL lookups can include host parameters just like path parameters

```python
routes = [
    Host("{subdomain}.example.org", name="sub", app=Router(routes=[
        Mount("/users", name="users", routes=[
            Route("/", user, name="user_list"),
            Route("/{username}", user, name="user_detail")
        ])
    ]))
]
...
url = request.url_for("sub:users:user_detail", username=..., subdomain=...)
url = request.url_for("sub:users:user_list", subdomain=...)
```

## Route priority

Incoming paths are matched against each `Route` in order.

In cases where more that one route could match an incoming path, you should
take care to ensure that more specific routes are listed before general cases.

For example:

```python
# Don't do this: `/users/me` will never match incoming requests.
routes = [
    Route('/users/{username}', user),
    Route('/users/me', current_user),
]

# Do this: `/users/me` is tested first.
routes = [
    Route('/users/me', current_user),
    Route('/users/{username}', user),
]
```

## Working with Router instances

If you're working at a low-level you might want to use a plain `Router`
instance, rather that creating a `Starlette` application. This gives you
a lightweight ASGI application that just provides the application routing,
without wrapping it up in any middleware.

```python
app = Router(routes=[
    Route('/', homepage),
    Mount('/users', routes=[
        Route('/', users, methods=['GET', 'POST']),
        Route('/{username}', user),
    ])
])
```

## WebSocket Routing

When working with WebSocket endpoints, you should use `WebSocketRoute`
instead of the usual `Route`.

Path parameters, and reverse URL lookups for `WebSocketRoute` work the the same
as HTTP `Route`, which can be found in the HTTP [Route](#http-routing) section above.

The `endpoint` argument can be one of:

* An async function, which accepts a single `websocket` argument.
* A class that implements the ASGI interface, such as Starlette's [WebSocketEndpoint](endpoints.md#websocketendpoint).


# endpoints.md


Starlette includes the classes `HTTPEndpoint` and `WebSocketEndpoint` that provide a class-based view pattern for
handling HTTP method dispatching and WebSocket sessions.

### HTTPEndpoint

The `HTTPEndpoint` class can be used as an ASGI application:

```python
from starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse
from starlette.endpoints import HTTPEndpoint


class App(HTTPEndpoint):
    async def get(self, request):
        return PlainTextResponse(f"Hello, world!")
```

If you're using a Starlette application instance to handle routing, you can
dispatch to an `HTTPEndpoint` class. Make sure to dispatch to the class itself,
rather than to an instance of the class:

```python
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse
from starlette.endpoints import HTTPEndpoint
from starlette.routing import Route


class Homepage(HTTPEndpoint):
    async def get(self, request):
        return PlainTextResponse(f"Hello, world!")


class User(HTTPEndpoint):
    async def get(self, request):
        username = request.path_params['username']
        return PlainTextResponse(f"Hello, {username}")

routes = [
    Route("/", Homepage),
    Route("/{username}", User)
]

app = Starlette(routes=routes)
```

HTTP endpoint classes will respond with "405 Method not allowed" responses for any
request methods which do not map to a corresponding handler.

### WebSocketEndpoint

The `WebSocketEndpoint` class is an ASGI application that presents a wrapper around
the functionality of a `WebSocket` instance.

The ASGI connection scope is accessible on the endpoint instance via `.scope` and
has an attribute `encoding` which may optionally be set, in order to validate the expected websocket data in the `on_receive` method.

The encoding types are:

* `'json'`
* `'bytes'`
* `'text'`

There are three overridable methods for handling specific ASGI websocket message types:

* `async def on_connect(websocket, **kwargs)`
* `async def on_receive(websocket, data)`
* `async def on_disconnect(websocket, close_code)`

The `WebSocketEndpoint` can also be used with the `Starlette` application class.


# middleware.md


Starlette includes several middleware classes for adding behavior that is applied across
your entire application. These are all implemented as standard ASGI
middleware classes, and can be applied either to Starlette or to any other ASGI application.

## Using middleware

The Starlette application class allows you to include the ASGI middleware
in a way that ensures that it remains wrapped by the exception handler.

```python
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.middleware import Middleware
from starlette.middleware.httpsredirect import HTTPSRedirectMiddleware
from starlette.middleware.trustedhost import TrustedHostMiddleware

routes = ...

# Ensure that all requests include an 'example.com' or
# '*.example.com' host header, and strictly enforce https-only access.
middleware = [
    Middleware(
        TrustedHostMiddleware,
        allowed_hosts=['example.com', '*.example.com'],
    ),
    Middleware(HTTPSRedirectMiddleware)
]

app = Starlette(routes=routes, middleware=middleware)
```

Every Starlette application automatically includes two pieces of middleware by default:

* `ServerErrorMiddleware` - Ensures that application exceptions may return a custom 500 page, or display an application traceback in DEBUG mode. This is *always* the outermost middleware layer.
* `ExceptionMiddleware` - Adds exception handlers, so that particular types of expected exception cases can be associated with handler functions. For example raising `HTTPException(status_code=404)` within an endpoint will end up rendering a custom 404 page.

Middleware is evaluated from top-to-bottom, so the flow of execution in our example
application would look like this:

* Middleware
    * `ServerErrorMiddleware`
    * `TrustedHostMiddleware`
    * `HTTPSRedirectMiddleware`
    * `ExceptionMiddleware`
* Routing
* Endpoint

The following middleware implementations are available in the Starlette package:

- CORSMiddleware
- SessionMiddleware
- HTTPSRedirectMiddleware
- TrustedHostMiddleware
- GZipMiddleware
- BaseHTTPMiddleware

# lifespan.md


Starlette applications can register a lifespan handler for dealing with
code that needs to run before the application starts up, or when the application
is shutting down.

```python
import contextlib

from starlette.applications import Starlette


@contextlib.asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app):
    async with some_async_resource():
        print("Run at startup!")
        yield
        print("Run on shutdown!")


routes = [
    ...
]

app = Starlette(routes=routes, lifespan=lifespan)
```

Starlette will not start serving any incoming requests until the lifespan has been run.

The lifespan teardown will run once all connections have been closed, and
any in-process background tasks have completed.

Consider using [`anyio.create_task_group()`](https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tasks.html)
for managing asynchronous tasks.

## Lifespan State

The lifespan has the concept of `state`, which is a dictionary that
can be used to share the objects between the lifespan, and the requests.

```python
import contextlib
from typing import AsyncIterator, TypedDict

import httpx
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.requests import Request
from starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse
from starlette.routing import Route


class State(TypedDict):
    http_client: httpx.AsyncClient


@contextlib.asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: Starlette) -> AsyncIterator[State]:
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        yield {"http_client": client}


async def homepage(request: Request) -> PlainTextResponse:
    client = request.state.http_client
    response = await client.get("https://www.example.com")
    return PlainTextResponse(response.text)


app = Starlette(
    lifespan=lifespan,
    routes=[Route("/", homepage)]
)
```

The `state` received on the requests is a **shallow** copy of the state received on the
lifespan handler.

## Running lifespan in tests

You should use `TestClient` as a context manager, to ensure that the lifespan is called.

```python
from example import app
from starlette.testclient import TestClient


def test_homepage():
    with TestClient(app) as client:
        # Application's lifespan is called on entering the block.
        response = client.get("/")
        assert response.status_code == 200

    # And the lifespan's teardown is run when exiting the block.
```


# background.md


Starlette includes a `BackgroundTask` class for in-process background tasks.

A background task should be attached to a response, and will run only once
the response has been sent.

### Background Task

Used to add a single background task to a response.

Signature: `BackgroundTask(func, *args, **kwargs)`

```python
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.responses import JSONResponse
from starlette.routing import Route
from starlette.background import BackgroundTask


...

async def signup(request):
    data = await request.json()
    username = data['username']
    email = data['email']
    task = BackgroundTask(send_welcome_email, to_address=email)
    message = {'status': 'Signup successful'}
    return JSONResponse(message, background=task)

async def send_welcome_email(to_address):
    ...


routes = [
    ...
    Route('/user/signup', endpoint=signup, methods=['POST'])
]

app = Starlette(routes=routes)
```

### BackgroundTasks

Used to add multiple background tasks to a response.

Signature: `BackgroundTasks(tasks=[])`

!!! important
    The tasks are executed in order. In case one of the tasks raises
    an exception, the following tasks will not get the opportunity to be executed.


# server-push.md


Starlette includes support for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 server push, making it
possible to push resources to the client to speed up page load times.

### `Request.send_push_promise`

Used to initiate a server push for a resource. If server push is not available
this method does nothing.

Signature: `send_push_promise(path)`

* `path` - A string denoting the path of the resource.

```python
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.responses import HTMLResponse
from starlette.routing import Route, Mount
from starlette.staticfiles import StaticFiles


async def homepage(request):
    """
    Homepage which uses server push to deliver the stylesheet.
    """
    await request.send_push_promise("/static/style.css")
    return HTMLResponse(
        '<html><head><link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/style.css"/></head></html>'
    )

routes = [
    Route("/", endpoint=homepage),
    Mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory="static"), name="static")
]

app = Starlette(routes=routes)
```


# exceptions.md


Starlette allows you to install custom exception handlers to deal with
how you return responses when errors or handled exceptions occur.

```python
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.exceptions import HTTPException
from starlette.requests import Request
from starlette.responses import HTMLResponse


HTML_404_PAGE = ...
HTML_500_PAGE = ...


async def not_found(request: Request, exc: HTTPException):
    return HTMLResponse(content=HTML_404_PAGE, status_code=exc.status_code)

async def server_error(request: Request, exc: HTTPException):
    return HTMLResponse(content=HTML_500_PAGE, status_code=exc.status_code)


exception_handlers = {
    404: not_found,
    500: server_error
}

app = Starlette(routes=routes, exception_handlers=exception_handlers)
```

If `debug` is enabled and an error occurs, then instead of using the installed
500 handler, Starlette will respond with a traceback response.

```python
app = Starlette(debug=True, routes=routes, exception_handlers=exception_handlers)
```

As well as registering handlers for specific status codes, you can also
register handlers for classes of exceptions.

In particular you might want to override how the built-in `HTTPException` class
is handled. For example, to use JSON style responses:

```python
async def http_exception(request: Request, exc: HTTPException):
    return JSONResponse({"detail": exc.detail}, status_code=exc.status_code)

exception_handlers = {
    HTTPException: http_exception
}
```

The `HTTPException` is also equipped with the `headers` argument. Which allows the propagation
of the headers to the response class:

```python
async def http_exception(request: Request, exc: HTTPException):
    return JSONResponse(
        {"detail": exc.detail},
        status_code=exc.status_code,
        headers=exc.headers
    )
```

You might also want to override how `WebSocketException` is handled:

```python
async def websocket_exception(websocket: WebSocket, exc: WebSocketException):
    await websocket.close(code=1008)

exception_handlers = {
    WebSocketException: websocket_exception
}
```

## Errors and handled exceptions

It is important to differentiate between handled exceptions and errors.

Handled exceptions do not represent error cases. They are coerced into appropriate
HTTP responses, which are then sent through the standard middleware stack. By default
the `HTTPException` class is used to manage any handled exceptions.

Errors are any other exception that occurs within the application. These cases
should bubble through the entire middleware stack as exceptions. Any error
logging middleware should ensure that it re-raises the exception all the
way up to the server.

In practical terms, the error handled used is `exception_handler[500]` or `exception_handler[Exception]`.
Both keys `500` and `Exception` can be used. See below:

```python
async def handle_error(request: Request, exc: HTTPException):
    # Perform some logic
    return JSONResponse({"detail": exc.detail}, status_code=exc.status_code)

exception_handlers = {
    Exception: handle_error  # or "500: handle_error"
}
```

It's important to notice that in case a [`BackgroundTask`](https://www.starlette.io/background/) raises an exception,
it will be handled by the `handle_error` function, but at that point, the response was already sent. In other words,
the response created by `handle_error` will be discarded. In case the error happens before the response was sent, then
it will use the response object - in the above example, the returned `JSONResponse`.

In order to deal with this behaviour correctly, the middleware stack of a
`Starlette` application is configured like this:

* `ServerErrorMiddleware` - Returns 500 responses when server errors occur.
* Installed middleware
* `ExceptionMiddleware` - Deals with handled exceptions, and returns responses.
* Router
* Endpoints

## HTTPException

The `HTTPException` class provides a base class that you can use for any
handled exceptions. The `ExceptionMiddleware` implementation defaults to
returning plain-text HTTP responses for any `HTTPException`.

* `HTTPException(status_code, detail=None, headers=None)`

You should only raise `HTTPException` inside routing or endpoints. Middleware
classes should instead just return appropriate responses directly.

## WebSocketException

You can use the `WebSocketException` class to raise errors inside of WebSocket endpoints.

* `WebSocketException(code=1008, reason=None)`

You can set any code valid as defined [in the specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.1).


# testclient.md


The test client allows you to make requests against your ASGI application,
using the `httpx` library.

```python
from starlette.responses import HTMLResponse
from starlette.testclient import TestClient


async def app(scope, receive, send):
    assert scope['type'] == 'http'
    response = HTMLResponse('<html><body>Hello, world!</body></html>')
    await response(scope, receive, send)


def test_app():
    client = TestClient(app)
    response = client.get('/')
    assert response.status_code == 200
```

The test client exposes the same interface as any other `httpx` session.
In particular, note that the calls to make a request are just standard
function calls, not awaitables.

You can use any of `httpx` standard API, such as authentication, session
cookies handling, or file uploads.

For example, to set headers on the TestClient you can do:

```python
client = TestClient(app)

# Set headers on the client for future requests
client.headers = {"Authorization": "..."}
response = client.get("/")

# Set headers for each request separately
response = client.get("/", headers={"Authorization": "..."})
```

And for example to send files with the TestClient:

```python
client = TestClient(app)

# Send a single file
with open("example.txt", "rb") as f:
    response = client.post("/form", files={"file": f})

# Send multiple files
with open("example.txt", "rb") as f1:
    with open("example.png", "rb") as f2:
        files = {"file1": f1, "file2": ("filename", f2, "image/png")}
        response = client.post("/form", files=files)
```

### Testing WebSocket sessions

You can also test websocket sessions with the test client.

The `httpx` library will be used to build the initial handshake, meaning you
can use the same authentication options and other headers between both http and
websocket testing.

```python
from starlette.testclient import TestClient
from starlette.websockets import WebSocket


async def app(scope, receive, send):
    assert scope['type'] == 'websocket'
    websocket = WebSocket(scope, receive=receive, send=send)
    await websocket.accept()
    await websocket.send_text('Hello, world!')
    await websocket.close()


def test_app():
    client = TestClient(app)
    with client.websocket_connect('/') as websocket:
        data = websocket.receive_text()
        assert data == 'Hello, world!'
```

#### Sending data

* `.send_text(data)` - Send the given text to the application.
* `.send_bytes(data)` - Send the given bytes to the application.
* `.send_json(data, mode="text")` - Send the given data to the application. Use `mode="binary"` to send JSON over binary data frames.

#### Receiving data

* `.receive_text()` - Wait for incoming text sent by the application and return it.
* `.receive_bytes()` - Wait for incoming bytestring sent by the application and return it.
* `.receive_json(mode="text")` - Wait for incoming json data sent by the application and return it. Use `mode="binary"` to receive JSON over binary data frames.

May raise `starlette.websockets.WebSocketDisconnect`.

#### Closing the connection

* `.close(code=1000)` - Perform a client-side close of the websocket connection.

### Asynchronous tests

Sometimes you will want to do async things outside of your application.
For example, you might want to check the state of your database after calling your app using your existing async database client / infrastructure.

For these situations, using `TestClient` is difficult because it creates it's own event loop and async resources (like a database connection) often cannot be shared across event loops.
The simplest way to work around this is to just make your entire test async and use an async client, like [httpx.AsyncClient].

Here is an example of such a test:

```python
from httpx import AsyncClient
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.routing import Route
from starlette.requests import Request
from starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse


def hello(request: Request) -> PlainTextResponse:
    return PlainTextResponse("Hello World!")


app = Starlette(routes=[Route("/", hello)])


# if you're using pytest, you'll need to to add an async marker like:
# @pytest.mark.anyio  # using https://github.com/agronholm/anyio
# or install and configure pytest-asyncio (https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio)
async def test_app() -> None:
    # note: you _must_ set `base_url` for relative urls like "/" to work
    async with AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://testserver") as client:
        r = await client.get("/")
        assert r.status_code == 200
        assert r.text == "Hello World!"
```</doc></optional></project>
