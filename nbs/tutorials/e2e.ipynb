    "#### Drawing Rooms\n",
    "\n",
    "Draw rooms are the core concept of our application. Each room represents a separate drawing space where a user can let there inner Picasso shine. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Room Creation and Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "db = database('data/drawapp.db')\n",
    "rooms = db.t.rooms\n",
    "if rooms not in db.t:\n",
    "    rooms.create(id=int, name=str, created_at=str, pk='id')\n",
    "Room = rooms.dataclass()\n",
    "\n",
    "@patch\n",
    "def __xt__(self:Room):\n",
    "    return Li(A(self.name, href=f\"/rooms/{self.id}\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or you can use our `fast_app` function to create a FastHTML app with a SQLite database and dataclass in one line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def render(room):\n",
    "    return Li(A(room.name, href=f\"/rooms/{room.id}\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "app,rt,rooms,Room = fast_app('data/drawapp.db', hdrs=(picolink,), render=render, id=int, name=str, created_at=str, pk='id')\n",
    "```\n",
    "We are specifying a render function to convert our dataclass into HTML, which is the same as extending the `__xt__` method from the `patch` decorator we used before. We will use this method for the rest of the tutorial since it is a lot cleaner and easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We're using a SQLite database (via FastLite) to store our rooms.\n",
    "* Each room has an id (integer), a name (string), and a created_at timestamp (string).\n",
    "* The Room dataclass is automatically generated based on this structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Creating a room\n",

    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "* When a user submits the \"Create Room\" form, this route is called.\n",
    "* It creates a new Room object, sets the creation time, and inserts it into the database.\n",
    "* It returns an HTML list item with a link to the new room, which is dynamically added to the room list on the homepage thanks to HTMX.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Let's give our rooms shape\n",

    "\n",

    "async def get(id:int):\n",
    "    room = rooms[id]\n",

    "    return room.canvas_data if room.canvas_data else \"{}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Update the JavaScript to load existing canvas data:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "js = f\"\"\"\n",
    "    var canvas = new fabric.Canvas('canvas');\n",
    "    canvas.isDrawingMode = true;\n",

    "### Conclusion: You're a FastHTML Artist Now! 🎨🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've just built a sleek, interactive web application using FastHTML. Let's recap what we've learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. FastHTML allows you to create dynamic web apps with minimal code.\n",
    "2. We used FastHTML's routing system to handle different pages and actions.\n",
    "3. We integrated with a SQLite database to store room information and canvas data.\n",
    "4. We utilized Fabric.js to create an interactive drawing canvas.\n",
    "5. We implemented features like color picking, brush size adjustment, and canvas saving.\n",
    "6. We used HTMX for seamless, partial page updates without full reloads.\n",
    "7. We learned how to deploy our FastHTML application to Railway for easy hosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've taken your first steps into the world of FastHTML development. From here, the possibilities are endless! You could enhance the drawing app further by adding features like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implementing different drawing tools (e.g., shapes, text)\n",
    "- Adding user authentication\n",
    "- Creating a gallery of saved drawings\n",
    "- Implementing real-time collaborative drawing using WebSockets\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever you choose to build next, FastHTML has got your back. Now go forth and create something awesome! Happy coding! 🖼️🚀"
