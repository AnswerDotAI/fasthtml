We're not saying its impossible to learn through copy/paste, we're just saying it's not that of an efficient way to learn. It's analogous to learning how to play a musical instrument or sport or video game by watching other people do it - you can learn some but its not the same as doing.\n",

This forces us to run the code through our brains, giving us actual practice in how to write FastHTML and Pythoncode and forcing us to debug our own mistakes. In some cases we'll repeat similar tasks - a key component in acheiving mastery in anything. Coming back to the instrument/sport/video game analogy, it's exactly like actually practicing an instrument, sport, or video game. Through practice and repition we eventually acheive mastery."
